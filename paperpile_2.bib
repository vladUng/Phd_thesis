              with important consequences for patients, carers, healthcare

              in the prevailing clinical, educational and scientific thinking

              generalist skills to balance the specialization trends of medical
              education and research. Multimorbidity is not a single entity but
              differs quantitively and qualitatively across life stages,
              ethnicities, sexes, socioeconomic groups and geographies.
              Data-driven science that quantifies the impact of disease
              co-occurrence-beyond the small number of currently well-studied
              long-term conditions (such as cardiometabolic diseases)-can help
              illuminate the pathological diversity of multimorbidity and
              identify common, mechanistically related, and prognostically
              relevant clusters. Broader access to data opportunities across
              modalities and disciplines will catalyze vertical and horizontal

  abstract  = "Summary This chapter describes the basic variants of the
               stochastic blockmodel (SBM), and a consistent Bayesian
               formulation that allows readers to infer them from data. The
               focus is on developing a framework to extract the large-scale
               structure of networks while avoiding both overfitting and
               underfitting, and doing so in a manner that is analytically
               tractable and computationally efficient. The Bayesian inference
               approach provides a methodologically correct answer to the very
               central question in network analysis of whether patterns of
               large-scale structure can in fact be supported by statistical
               evidence. Besides this practical aspect, it also opens a window
               into the fundamental limits of network analysis itself, giving
               readers a theoretical underpinning we can use to understand more
               about the nature of network systems. The chapter shows how
               inferring the SBM can be used to predict missing and spurious
               links and also sheds light on the fundamental limitations of the
               detectability of modular structures in networks.",

              upregulation of MHC class I/II and de novo expression of the T

              to multiple cancer types often showing a tissue-specific
              functional impact. This tissue-specificity means that the biology
              of normal tissues carries important information regarding the

              be leveraged to improve the power and accuracy of cancer genomic
              analyses. Research exploring the use of normal tissue data for
              the analysis of cancer genomics has primarily focused on the
              paired analysis of tumor and adjacent normal samples. Efforts to
              leverage the general characteristics of normal tissue for cancer
              analysis has received less attention with most investigations

              to individual genomic alterations or dysregulated pathways within
              a single cancer type. To address this gap and support scenarios
              where adjacent normal tissue samples are not available, we
              explored the genome-wide association between the transcriptomes
              of 21 solid human cancers and their associated normal tissues as
              profiled in healthy individuals. While the average gene
              expression profiles of normal and cancerous tissue may appear
              distinct, with normal tissues more similar to other normal
              tissues than to the associated cancer types, when transformed

              cancers, the close association between gene activity in normal
              tissues and related cancers is revealed. As we demonstrate
              through an analysis of tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
              and normal tissue data from the Human Protein Atlas, this
              association between tissue-specific and cancer-specific
              expression values can be leveraged to improve the prognostic

              combined with classifiers and Deep Neural Networks showing a
              validation rate as high as 59\% and a recognition rate of 56\%.
              The focus of this dissertation will be on facial based emotion
              recognition. This consists of detecting facial expressions in
              images and videos. While the majority of research uses human
              faces in an attempt to recognise basic emotions, there has been
              little research on whether the same deep learning techniques can
              be applied to faces in cartoons. The system implemented in this
              paper, aims to classify at most three emotions (happiness, anger

              Ekman and Friesen, with an accuracy of 80\% for the 3 emotions.

              driver gene mutations is bounded, indicating that there must be a

              One of these methods, described here, incorporated a
              machine-learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the
              driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely.
              Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were
              inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into
              question the assumptions that were used to generate them.
              Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained
              variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene
              predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses
              of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance
              for improving them in the future.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identifying the complete repertoire of genes that
              drive cancer in individual patients is crucial for precision
              oncology. Most established methods identify driver genes that are
              recurrently altered across patient cohorts. However, mapping
              these genes back to patients leaves a sizeable fraction with few
              or no drivers, hindering our understanding of cancer mechanisms
              and limiting the choice of therapeutic interventions. RESULTS: We
              present sysSVM2, a machine learning software that integrates
              cancer genetic alterations with gene systems-level properties to
              predict drivers in individual patients. Using simulated
              pan-cancer data, we optimise sysSVM2 for application to any
              cancer type. We benchmark its performance on real cancer data and
              validate its applicability to a rare cancer type with few known
              driver genes. We show that drivers predicted by sysSVM2 have a
              low false-positive rate, are stable and disrupt well-known
              cancer-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: sysSVM2 can be used to
              identify driver alterations in patients lacking sufficient
              canonical drivers or belonging to rare cancer types for which
              assembling a large enough cohort is challenging, furthering the
              goals of precision oncology. As resources for the community, we
              provide the code to implement sysSVM2 and the pre-trained models

  abstract = "Cancer is a complex disease with a high rate of mortality. The
              characteristics of tumor masses are very heterogeneous; thus, the
              appropriate classification of tumors is a critical point in the
              effective treatment. A high level of heterogeneity has also been
              observed in breast cancer. Therefore, detecting the molecular
              subtypes of this disease is an essential issue for medicine that
              could be facilitated using bioinformatics. This study aims to
              discover the molecular subtypes of breast cancer using somatic
              mutation profiles of tumors. Nonetheless, the somatic mutation
              profiles are very sparse. Therefore, a network propagation method
              is used in the gene interaction network to make the mutation
              profiles dense. Afterward, the deep embedded clustering (DEC)
              method is used to classify the breast tumors into four subtypes.
              In the next step, gene signature of each subtype is obtained
              using Fisher's exact test. Besides the enrichment of gene
              signatures in numerous biological databases, clinical and
              molecular analyses verify that the proposed method using mutation
              profiles can efficiently detect the molecular subtypes of breast
              cancer. Finally, a supervised classifier is trained based on the
              discovered subtypes to predict the molecular subtype of a new

              personalized prognosis/treatment. The increasing availability of
              tumor related molecular data provides the opportunity to identify
              molecular subtypes in a data-driven way. Molecular subtypes are
              defined as groups of samples that have a similar molecular
              mechanism at the origin of the carcinogenesis. The molecular
              mechanisms are reflected by subtype-specific mutational and
              expression features. Data-driven subtyping is a complex problem
              as subtyping and identifying the molecular mechanisms that drive
              carcinogenesis are confounded problems. Many current integrative
              subtyping methods use global mutational and/or expression tumor
              profiles to group tumor samples in subtypes but do not explicitly
              extract the subtype-specific features. We therefore present a
              method that solves both tasks of subtyping and identification of
              subtype-specific features simultaneously. Hereto our method
              integrates` mutational and expression data while taking into
              account the clonal properties of carcinogenesis. Key to our
              method is a formalization of the problem as a rank matrix
              factorization of ranked data that approaches the subtyping
              problem as multi-view bi-clustering RESULTS: We introduce a novel
              integrative framework to identify subtypes by combining
              mutational and expression features. The incomparable measurement
              data is integrated by transformation into ranked data and
              subtypes are defined as multi-view bi-clusters We formalize the
              model using rank matrix factorization, resulting in the SRF
              algorithm. Experiments on simulated data and the TCGA breast

  abstract = "Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is important for
              biomedical applications, as it is required for a comprehensive
              understanding of biological function. Integrating multi-omics
              data serves multiple purposes, such as, an integrated data model,
              dimensionality reduction of omic features, patient clustering,
              etc. For oncological data, patient clustering is synonymous to
              cancer subtype prediction. However, there is a gap in combining
              some of the widely used integrative analyses to build more
              powerful tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a multi-level
              integration algorithm to identify representative integrative
              subspace and use it for cancer subtype prediction. The three
              integrative approaches we implement on multi-omics features are,
              (1) multivariate multiple (linear) regression of the features
              from a cohort of patients/samples, (2) network construction using
              different omics features, and (3) fusion of sample similarity
              networks across the features. We use a type of multilayer
              network, called heterogeneous network, as a data model to
              transition between a network-free (NF) regression model and a
              network-based (NB) model, which uses correlation networks. The
              heterogeneous networks consist of intra- and inter-layer graphs.
              Our proposed heterogeneous correlation network model, HCNM, is
              central to our algorithm for gene-ranking, integrative subspace
              identification, and tumor-specific subtypes prediction. The genes
              of our representative integrative subspace have been enriched
              with gene-ontology and found to exhibit significant gene-disease
              association (GDA) scores. The subspace in genes which is less
              than 5\% of the total gene-set of each genomic feature is used
              with NB fusion integrative model to predict sample subtypes. As

  abstract = "Correlation in the broadest sense is a measure of an association
              between variables. In correlated data, the change in the
              magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the
              magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive
              correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction.
              Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a
              linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed
              as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation
              coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed
              data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For
              nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for
              data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be
              used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation
              coefficients are scaled such that they range from -1 to +1, where
              0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and
              the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a
              straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or
              decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient
              approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and
              confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical
              significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the
              relationship in the population from which the data were sampled.

  abstract  = "It remains to be determined how different inputs for
               memory-encoding, such as the use of paper notebooks or mobile
               devices, affect retrieval processes. We compared three groups of
               participants who read dialogues on personal schedules and wrote
               down the scheduled appointments on a calendar using a paper
               notebook (Note), an electronic tablet (Tablet), or a smartphone
               (Phone). After the retention period for an hour including an
               interference task, we tested recognition memory of those
               appointments with visually presented questions in a retrieval
               task, while scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging.
               We obtained three major results. First, the duration of writing
               down schedules was significantly shorter for the Note group than
               the Tablet and Phone groups, and accuracy was much higher for
               the Note group in easier (i.e., more straightforward) questions.
               Because the input methods were equated as much as possible
               between the Note and Tablet groups, these results indicate that
               the cognitive processes for the Note group were deeper and more
               solid. Second, brain activations for all participants during the
               retrieval phase were localized in the bilateral hippocampus,
               precuneus, visual cortices, and language-related frontal
               regions, confirming the involvement of verbalized memory
               retrieval processes for appointments. Third, activations in
               these regions were significantly higher for the Note group than
               those for the Tablet and Phone groups. These enhanced
               activations for the Note group could not be explained by general
               cognitive loads or task difficulty, because overall task
               performances were similar among the groups. The significant
               superiority in both accuracy and activations for the Note group
               suggested that the use of a paper notebook promoted the
               acquisition of rich encoding information and/or spatial
               information of real papers and that this information could be
               utilized as effective retrieval clues, leading to higher

              clusters across 850 experiments. We found Infomap and Markov
              Clustering (MCL) community detection methods to have high

              search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in
              hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web
              efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than
              existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink
              database of at least 24 million pages is available at
              http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a
              challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of
              millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct
              terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite
              the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very
              little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due
              to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a
              Web search engine today is very different from three years ago.
              This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale
              Web search engine --- the first such detailed public description

              are new technical challenges involved with using the additional

              practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional

              includes neurosurgical resection of the tumour, in which a
              delicate balance must be struck between maximizing the extent of
              resection and minimizing risk of neurological damage and
              comorbidity2,3. However, surgeons have limited knowledge of the
              precise tumour type prior to surgery. Current standard practice
              relies on preoperative imaging and intraoperative histological
              analysis, but these are not always conclusive and occasionally
              wrong. Using rapid nanopore sequencing, a sparse methylation

              enable molecular subclassification of central nervous system

              (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets
              across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. While
              the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on
              standard analysis of clustering and differential expression,
              leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized
              dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to
              unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation,
              which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences.
              Community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time
              points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the
              existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and
              multiple time points simultaneously. To address this, we develop
              Multi-subject Dynamic Community Detection (MuDCoD) for
              multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene
              networks from scRNA-seq. MuDCoD builds on the spectral clustering
              framework and promotes information sharing among the networks of
              the subjects as well as networks at different time points. It
              clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and
              reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only
              across time but also among subjects. RESULTS: Evaluation and
              benchmarking of MuDCoD against existing approaches reveal that
              MuDCoD effectively leverages apparent shared signals among
              networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs
              robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the
              networks. Applications to population-scale scRNA-seq datasets of
              human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron
              differentiation and CD4+ T cell activation indicate that MuDCoD
              enables robust inference for identifying time-varying
              personalized gene modules. Our results illustrate how
              personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the
              exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary
              across time. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MuDCoD is publicly

               This paper proposes a new algorithm, Differential Evolution
               based Community Detection (DECD), which employs a novel
               optimization algorithm, differential evolution (DE) for
               detecting communities in complex networks. DE uses network
               modularity as the fitness function to search for an optimal
               partition of a network. Based on the standard DE crossover
               operator, we design a modified binomial crossover to effectively
               transmit some important information about the community
               structure in evolution. Moreover, a biased initialization
               process and a clean-up operation are employed in DECD to improve
               the quality of individuals in the population. One of the
               distinct merits of DECD is that, unlike many other community
               detection algorithms, DECD does not require any prior knowledge
               about the community structure, which is particularly useful for
               its application to real-world complex networks where prior
               knowledge is usually not available. We evaluate DECD on several

  abstract = "Networks-based approaches are often used to analyze gene
              expression data or protein-protein interactions but are not
              usually applied to study the relationships between different
              biomarkers. Given the clinical need for more comprehensive and
              integrative biomarkers that can help to identify personalized
              therapies, the integration of biomarkers of different natures is
              an emerging trend in the literature. Network analysis can be used
              to analyze the relationships between different features of a
              disease; nodes can be disease-related phenotypes, gene
              expression, mutational events, protein quantification,
              imaging-derived features and more. Since different biomarkers can
              exert causal effects between them, describing such
              interrelationships can be used to better understand the
              underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. Networks as biomarkers
              are not yet commonly used, despite being proven to lead to
              interesting results. Here, we discuss in which ways they have

  abstract = "BACKGROUNDS: Despite the genomic landscape of urothelial
              carcinomas (UC) patients, especially those with UC of bladder
              (UCB), has been comprehensively delineated and associated with
              pathogenetic mechanisms and treatment preferences, the genomic
              characterization of upper tract UC (UTUC) has yet to be fully
              elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 131 Chinese UTUC
              (74 renal pelvis \& 57 ureter) and 118 UCB patients were enrolled
              in the present study, and targeted next-generation sequencing
              (NGS) of 618 cancer-associated genes were conducted to exhibit
              the profile of somatic and germline alterations. The COSMIC
              database, including 30 mutational signatures, were utilized to
              evaluate the mutational spectrums. Moreover, TCGA-UCB, MSKCC-UCB,
              and MSKCC-UTUC datasets were retrieved for preforming genomic
              alterations (GAs) comparison analysis between Western and Chinese
              UC patients. RESULTS: In our cohort, 93.98\% and 56.63\% of UC
              patients were identified with oncogenic and actionable somatic
              alterations, respectively. Meanwhile, 11.24\% of Chinese UC
              patients (of 14.50\% and 7.63\% of UTUC and UCB cases,
              respectively) were identified to harbor a total of 32
              pathogenic/likely-pathogenic germline variants in 22 genes, with
              DNA damage repair (DDR)-associated BRCA1 (1.20\%) and CHEK2
              (1.20\%) being the most prevalent. Chinese UTUC and UCB patients
              possessed distinct somatic genomic characteristics, especially
              with significantly different prevalence in KMT2D/C/A, GNAQ,
              ERCC2, RB1, and PPM1D. In addition, we also found notable
              differences in the prevalence of ELF3, TP53, PMS2, and FAT4
              between renal pelvis and ureter carcinomas. Moreover, 22.90\% and
              33.90\% of UTUC and UCB patients, respectively, had at least one
              deleterious/likely deleterious alteration in DDR related
              genes/pathways. Subsequently, mutational signature analysis
              revealed that UC patients with mutational signature 22,
              irrespective of UTUC or UCB, consistently had the markedly higher
              level of tumor mutational burden (TMB), which was proved to be
              positively correlated with the objective complete/partial
              response rate in the IMvigor210 cohort. By comparison, Chinese
              and Western UTUC patients also differed regrading GAs in
              oncogenic-related genes/pathways, especially in TP53, RTK/RAS,
              and PI3K pathways; besides, more alterations in WNT pathway but
              less TP53, RTK/RAS, HIPPO, and PI3K pathways were identified in
              Chinese UCB. DISCUSSIONS: The in-depth analysis of genomic
              mutational landscapes revealed distinct pathogenetic mechanisms
              between Chinese UTUC and UCB, and specific genomic
              characterizations could identify high risk population of UTUC/UCB

              that sample the visual scene as a series of high-resolution
              images. These are then processed using convolutional neural
              networks using neurons with continuous outputs. Biological vision
              systems use a quite different approach, where the eyes (cameras)
              sample the visual scene continuously, often with a non-uniform
              resolution, and generate neural spike events in response to
              changes in the scene. The resulting spatio-temporal patterns of
              events are then processed through networks of spiking neurons.
              Such event-based processing offers advantages in terms of
              focusing constrained resources on the most salient features of
              the perceived scene, and those advantages should also accrue to
              engineered vision systems based upon similar principles.

              exemplified by the SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network

  abstract = "Introduction: Parkinson's disease affects over 10 million people
              globally, and ∼20\% of patients with Parkinson's disease have not
              been diagnosed as such. The clinical diagnosis is costly: there
              are no specific tests or biomarkers and it can take days to
              diagnose as it relies on a holistic evaluation of the
              individual's symptoms. Existing research either predicts a
              Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale rating, uses other key
              Parkinsonian features such as tapping, gait, and tremor to
              diagnose an individual, or focuses on different audio features.
              Methods: In this article, we present a classification approach
              implemented as an iOS App to detect whether an individual has
              Parkinson's using 10-s audio clips of the individual saying
              ``aaah'' into a smartphone. Results: The 1,000 voice samples
              analyzed were obtained from the mPower (mobile Parkinson Disease)
              study, which collected 65,022 voice samples from 5,826 unique

  abstract      = "Methods for understanding the decisions of and mechanisms
                   underlying deep neural networks (DNNs) typically rely on
                   building intuition by emphasizing sensory or semantic
                   features of individual examples. For instance, methods aim
                   to visualize the components of an input which are
                   ``important'' to a network's decision, or to measure the
                   semantic properties of single neurons. Here, we argue that
                   interpretability research suffers from an over-reliance on
                   intuition-based approaches that risk-and in some cases have
                   caused-illusory progress and misleading conclusions. We
                   identify a set of limitations that we argue impede
                   meaningful progress in interpretability research, and
                   examine two popular classes of interpretability
                   methods-saliency and single-neuron-based approaches-that
                   serve as case studies for how overreliance on intuition and
                   lack of falsifiability can undermine interpretability
                   research. To address these concerns, we propose a strategy
                   to address these impediments in the form of a framework for
                   strongly falsifiable interpretability research. We encourage
                   researchers to use their intuitions as a starting point to
                   develop and test clear, falsifiable hypotheses, and hope
                   that our framework yields robust, evidence-based
                   interpretability methods that generate meaningful advances

               alternative approach to optimization, in recent years
               backpropagation through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has
               come to dominate the fields of neural network optimization and
               deep learning. One hypothesis for the absence of EAs in deep
               learning is that modern neural networks have become so high
               dimensional that evolution with its inexact gradient cannot
               match the exact gradient calculations of backpropagation.
               Furthermore, the evaluation of a single individual in evolution
               on the big data sets now prevalent in deep learning would
               present a prohibitive obstacle towards efficient optimization.
               This paper challenges these views, suggesting that EAs can be
               made to run significantly faster than previously thought by
               evaluating individuals only on a small number of training
               examples per generation. Surprisingly, using this approach with
               only a simple EA (called the limited evaluation EA or LEEA) is
               competitive with the performance of the state-of-the-art SGD
               variant RMSProp on several benchmarks with neural networks with
               over 1,000 weights. More investigation is warranted, but these
               initial results suggest the possibility that EAs could be the
               first viable training alternative for deep learning outside of

                   evolutionary algorithms will likely see increased use and
                   development due to the increased availability of
                   computation, more robust and available open source software
                   libraries, and the increasing demand for artificial
                   intelligence techniques. As these techniques become more
                   adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a
                   perspective of their ability to integrate into society and
                   the human processes they intend to augment. In this review,
                   we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms and
                   resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the
                   ability to manage the control of the environment with

                   bias due to data or user design, and lastly, the ability to
                   add corrective measures. These areas are motivated by
                   today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Feature selection, as a preprocessing stage, is a
              challenging problem in various sciences such as biology,
              engineering, computer science, and other fields. For this
              purpose, some studies have introduced tools and softwares such as
              WEKA. Meanwhile, these tools or softwares are based on filter
              methods which have lower performance relative to wrapper methods.
              In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce a
              software application called FeatureSelect. In addition to filter
              methods, FeatureSelect consists of optimisation algorithms and
              three types of learners. It provides a user-friendly and
              straightforward method of feature selection for use in any kind
              of research, and can easily be applied to any type of balanced
              and unbalanced data based on several score functions like
              accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. RESULTS: In addition to
              our previously introduced optimisation algorithm (WCC), a total
              of 10 efficient, well-known and recently developed algorithms
              have been implemented in FeatureSelect. We applied our software
              to a range of different datasets and evaluated the performance of
              its algorithms. Acquired results show that the performances of
              algorithms are varying on different datasets, but WCC, LCA, FOA,
              and LA are suitable than others in the overall state. The results

                   world and an evaluative feedback. Unlike traditional
                   supervised learning methods that usually rely on one-shot,

                   sequential decision making problems with sampled, evaluative

  abstract = "This paper attempts to answer a central question in unsupervised
              learning: what does it mean to ``make sense'' of a sensory
              sequence? In our formalization, making sense involves
              constructing a symbolic causal theory that both explains the
              sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions.
              The unity conditions insist that the constituents of the causal
              theory -- objects, properties, and laws -- must be integrated
              into a coherent whole. On our account, making sense of sensory
              input is a type of program synthesis, but it is unsupervised
              program synthesis. Our second contribution is a computer
              implementation, the Apperception Engine, that was designed to
              satisfy the above requirements. Our system is able to produce
              interpretable human-readable causal theories from very small
              amounts of data, because of the strong inductive bias provided by
              the unity conditions. A causal theory produced by our system is
              able to predict future sensor readings, as well as retrodict
              earlier readings, and impute (fill in the blanks of) missing
              sensory readings, in any combination. In fact, it is able to do
              all three tasks simultaneously. We tested the engine in a diverse
              variety of domains, including cellular automata, rhythms and
              simple nursery tunes, multi-modal binding problems, occlusion
              tasks, and sequence induction intelligence tests. In each domain,
              we test our engine's ability to predict future sensor values,
              retrodict earlier sensor values, and impute missing sensory data.
              The Apperception Engine performs well in all these domains,
              significantly out-performing neural net baselines. We note in
              particular that in the sequence induction intelligence tests, our
              system achieved human-level performance. This is notable because
              our system is not a bespoke system designed specifically to solve
              intelligence tests, but a general-purpose system that was
              designed to make sense of any sensory sequence.",

              three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid
              sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the
              structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however,
              protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally.
              Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging
              genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid
              residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous
              sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3.
              Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate
              predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which
              convey more information about the structure than contact
              predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of
              mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein.
              We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple
              gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex
              sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold,
              achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous
              sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure
              Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment of the state of the
              field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template
              modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free
              modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used
              sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only
              14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance
              in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased
              accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of
              proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for
              homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.",

               and unpredictable world, an intelligent agent should hold its
               own meta-goal of self-preservation, like living organisms whose
               survival relies on homeostasis: the regulation of body states
               aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. In
               organisms capable of mental states, feelings are a mental
               expression of the state of life in the body and play a critical
               role in regulating behaviour. Our goal here is to inquire about
               conditions that would potentially allow machines to care about
               what they do or think. Under certain conditions, machines
               capable of implementing a process resembling homeostasis might
               also acquire a source of motivation and a new means to evaluate

              is able to determine which synapses should change, and by how
              much. This uncertainty stands in sharp contrast to deep learning,
              where changes in weights are explicitly engineered to optimize
              performance. However, the main tool for doing that,
              backpropagation, is not biologically plausible, and networks
              trained with this rule tend to forget old tasks when learning new
              ones. Here we introduce the Dendritic Gated Network (DGN), a
              variant of the Gated Linear Network [[1][1], [2][2]], which
              offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.
              DGNs combine dendritic ``gating'' (whereby interneurons target
              dendrites to shape neuronal response) with local learning rules
              to yield provably efficient performance. They are significantly
              more data efficient than conventional artificial networks and are
              highly resistant to forgetting, and we show that they perform
              well on a variety of tasks, in some cases better than
              backpropagation. The DGN bears similarities to the cerebellum,
              where there is evidence for shaping of Purkinje cell responses by

                   technical challenges are significant, starting with an
                   accurate neuroscience model of how the brain works, to

                   devices to support these models, to creating a programming
                   framework so the systems can learn, to creating applications
                   with brain-like capabilities. In this work, we provide a
                   comprehensive survey of the research and motivations for
                   neuromorphic computing over its history. We begin with a
                   35-year review of the motivations and drivers of
                   neuromorphic computing, then look at the major research
                   areas of the field, which we define as neuro-inspired
                   models, algorithms and learning approaches, hardware and
                   devices, supporting systems, and finally applications. We
                   conclude with a broad discussion on the major research
                   topics that need to be addressed in the coming years to see
                   the promise of neuromorphic computing fulfilled. The goals
                   of this work are to provide an exhaustive review of the
                   research conducted in neuromorphic computing since the
                   inception of the term, and to motivate further work by

              fundamental challenge for neuroscience. In particular,
              self-organized behavioral development provides more questions
              than answers. Are there special functional units for curiosity,

              can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring
              any higher-level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic
              plasticity (DEP) as a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems

              case. Without specifying any purpose or goal, seemingly
              purposeful and adaptive rhythmic behavior is developed,
              displaying a certain level of sensorimotor intelligence. These
              surprising results require no system-specific modifications of
              the DEP rule. They rather arise from the underlying mechanism of
              spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is due to the tight brain
              body environment coupling. The new synaptic rule is biologically
              plausible and would be an interesting target for neurobiological

              remains unclear, and has been relatively little explored in
              models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the
              performance of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks
              of real-world difficulty, with varying degrees of heterogeneity,
              and found that it substantially improved task performance.
              Learning was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with
              a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution of
              neuronal parameters in the trained networks closely matches those

              presynaptic neuron fires shortly after, a phenomenon known as
              Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). When a neuron is
              presented successively with discrete volleys of input spikes STDP
              has been shown to learn 'early spike patterns', that is to
              concentrate synaptic weights on afferents that consistently fire
              early, with the result that the postsynaptic spike latency

              selective responses poses a significant challenge for
              computational models of object recognition. Typically, many
              objects make up a complex natural scene and are never presented
              in isolation. Nonetheless, the visual system is able to build
              invariant object selective responses. In this paper, we present a
              model of the ventral visual stream, VisNet, which can solve the
              problem of learning object selective representations even when
              multiple objects are always present during training. Past
              research with the VisNet model has shown that the network can

              In this research, we show for the first time that VisNet is
              capable of utilizing the statistics inherent in independent

              explain how transform-invariant cells could develop in the visual

  abstract = "We discuss a recently proposed approach to solve the classic
              feature-binding problem in primate vision that uses neural
              dynamics known to be present within the visual cortex. Broadly,
              the feature-binding problem in the visual context concerns not
              only how a hierarchy of features such as edges and objects within
              a scene are represented, but also the hierarchical relationships
              between these features at every spatial scale across the visual
              field. This is necessary for the visual brain to be able to make
              sense of its visuospatial world. Solving this problem is an
              important step towards the development of artificial general
              intelligence. In neural network simulation studies, it has been
              found that neurons encoding the binding relations between visual
              features, known as binding neurons, emerge during visual training
              when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into
              the models. These biological network properties include (i)
              bottom-up, lateral and top-down synaptic connections, (ii)
              spiking neuronal dynamics, (iii) spike timing-dependent
              plasticity, and (iv) a random distribution of axonal transmission
              delays (of the order of several milliseconds) in the propagation
              of spikes between neurons. After training the network on a set of
              visual stimuli, modelling studies have reported observing the
              gradual emergence of polychronization through successive layers
              of the network, in which subpopulations of neurons have learned
              to emit their spikes in regularly repeating spatio-temporal
              patterns in response to specific visual stimuli. Such a
              subpopulation of neurons is known as a polychronous neuronal
              group (PNG). Some neurons embedded within these PNGs receive
              convergent inputs from neurons representing lower- and
              higher-level visual features, and thus appear to encode the
              hierarchical binding relationship between features. Neural
              activity with this kind of spatio-temporal structure robustly
              emerges in the higher network layers even when neurons in the
              input layer represent visual stimuli with spike timings that are
              randomized according to a Poisson distribution. The resulting
              hierarchical representation of visual scenes in such models,
              including the representation of hierarchical binding relations
              between lower- and higher-level visual features, is consistent
              with the hierarchical phenomenology or subjective experience of
              primate vision and is distinct from approaches interested in
              segmenting a visual scene into a finite set of objects.",

  abstract = "How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central
              question in neuroscience. Key to today's research into
              information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic
              plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's
              (1949) postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and
              persistently co-active cells should increase connective strength
              among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing
              a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not
              the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history.
              Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical
              frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were
              directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent
              years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where
              temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new
              learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity
              (STDP) - has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because
              of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological
              plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of
              today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of
              diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle,
              Locke, and Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticit{\`a} and
              Rosenblatt's perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of
              STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and
              experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred
              in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field,
              and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point
              out where the future directions may lie, which includes
              interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms
              and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to

              has resulted in a large body of models. They are usually inspired
              by -- and fitted to -- experimental data, but they rarely produce
              neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures
              suggest that current plasticity models are still
              under-constrained by existing data. Here, we present an
              alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover
              plausible synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental
              data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement
              and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we
              parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion
              and then use supervised learning methods (gradient descent or
              evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss
              function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity
              rule transforms an initially random network into one with the
              desired function. We first validate our approach by
              re-discovering previously described plasticity rules, starting at
              the single-neuron level and ``Oja's rule'', a simple Hebbian
              plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability
              of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We
              expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to
              find Oja's rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an
              initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover
              several principal components of the input space after learning.
              Next, we move to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with
              plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a
              target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. Our algorithm
              discovers a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can
              solve this task. Our work is a proof of principle of an automated
              and unbiased approach to unveil synaptic plasticity rules that
              obey biological constraints and can solve complex functions.

                 important role, only a few of these connections have been

              conditions, the transitioning behaviour of the network from

              network from recalling all memories, with scaling similar to what

              temporal context vectors adapted from the temporal context model
              (TCM). These vectors are leaky integrators that could be
              constructed from a population of persistently firing cells. An
              array of temporal context vectors with different decay rates
              calculates the Laplace transform of real time events. Simple
              bands of feedforward excitatory and inhibitory connections from

              carcinogenesis in different epithelia. To develop an experimental
              model of bladder carcinogenesis, we clonally expanded in vitro
              differentiated normal human urothelial (NHU) cells following
              exposure to an exemplar procarcinogen and used whole-genome DNA
              sequencing to derive mutational signatures. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)
              was activated by endogenous cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450
              family 1 subfamily A member 1 [CYP1A1]) to create genomically
              modified NHU cells. Comparison with the Catalogue of Somatic
              Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) showed that mutations induced by BaP
              in NHU cells were similar to smoking-associated signatures in
              bladder and other cancers, including single- and doublet-base
              substitution signatures characterised by C > A transversions
              (COSMIC\_SBS4 and COSMIC\_DBS2, respectively), and an
              insertion/deletion signature of C deletions in homopolymer
              regions (COSMIC ID3). Our study provides the first direct
              evidence that BaP is activated locally in the urothelium,
              initiating the well-described smoking-associated mutational
              signatures. An absence of other common bladder cancer
              (BLCA)-associated genomic signatures points strongly to other
              primary causes of BLCA, which the new experimental approach
              described here is well placed to investigate. Mutational
              signatures ignore whether genes are affected, but tissue-specific
              drivers (KMT2D, KMT2C, and CDKN1A) were significantly overmutated
              in this model, providing insight on the emergent selection
              pressures. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a carefully controlled laboratory
              setting, we exposed normal human urothelial tissues to a
              procarcinogen (benzo[a]pyrene) found in cigarette smoke. We show
              that the urothelial tissues activated the carcinogen and led to
              mutations forming across the genome in a characteristic pattern.
              This particular ``mutational signature'' is found in bladder
              tumours and other smoking-induced cancers (eg, lung); however,
              our study highlights that there are other unknown mutational
              processes in bladder cancer that is not the direct result of
              smoke carcinogens, and this will require further investigation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As DNA sequencing technologies are improving and
              getting cheaper, genomic data can be utilized for diagnosis of
              many diseases such as cancer. Human raw genome data is huge in
              size for computational systems. Therefore, there is a need for a
              compact and accurate representation of the valuable information
              in DNA. The occurrence of complex genetic disorders often results
              from multiple gene mutations. The effect of each mutation is not
              equal for the development of a disease. Inspired from the field
              of information retrieval, we propose using the term frequency
              (tf) and BM25 term weighting measures with the inverse document
              frequency (idf) and relevance frequency (rf) measures to weight
              genes based on their mutations. The underlying assumption is that
              the more mutations a gene has in patients with a certain disease
              and the less mutations it has in other patients, the more
              discriminative that gene is. RESULTS: We evaluated the proposed
              representations on the task of cancer type classification. We
              applied various machine learning techniques using the tf-idf and
              tf-rf schemes and their BM25 versions. Our results show that the
              BM25-tf-rf representation leads to improved classification
              accuracy and f-score values compared to the other
              representations. The highest accuracy (76.44\%) and f-score
              (76.95\%) are achieved with the BM25-tf-rf based data
              representation. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of our experiments, the
              BM25-tf-rf scheme and the proposed neural network model is shown
              to be the best performing classification system for our case
              study of cancer type classification. This system is further
              utilized for causal gene analysis. Examples from the most
              effective genes that are used for decision making are found to be
              in the literature as target or causal genes.",

  abstract = "Motivation: Somatic mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor
              suppressor genes constitute a major category of causal genetic
              abnormalities in tumor cells. The mutation spectra of thousands
              of tumors have been generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
              and other whole genome (exome) sequencing projects. A promising
              approach to utilizing these resources for precision medicine is
              to identify genetic similarity-based sub-types within a cancer
              type and relate the pinpointed sub-types to the clinical outcomes
              and pathologic characteristics of patients. Results: We propose
              two novel methods, ccpwModel and xGeneModel, for mutation-based
              clustering of tumors. In the former, binary variables indicating
              the status of cancer driver genes in tumors and the genes'
              involvement in the core cancer pathways are treated as the
              features in the clustering process. In the latter, the functional
              similarities of putative cancer driver genes and their confidence
              scores as the 'true' driver genes are integrated with the
              mutation spectra to calculate the genetic distances between
              tumors. We apply both methods to the TCGA data of 16 cancer
              types. Promising results are obtained when these methods are
              compared to state-of-the-art approaches as to the associations
              between the determined tumor clusters and patient race (or
              survival time). We further extend the analysis to detect
              mutation-characterized transcriptomic prognostic signatures,
              which are directly relevant to the etiology of carcinogenesis.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a
              molecularly diverse disease with heterogeneous clinical outcomes.
              Several molecular classifications have been proposed, but the
              diversity of their subtype sets impedes their clinical
              application. OBJECTIVE: To achieve an international consensus on
              MIBC molecular subtypes that reconciles the published
              classification schemes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We
              used 1750 MIBC transcriptomic profiles from 16 published datasets
              and two additional cohorts. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL
              ANALYSIS: We performed a network-based analysis of six
              independent MIBC classification systems to identify a consensus
              set of molecular classes. Association with survival was assessed
              using multivariable Cox models. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We
              report the results of an international effort to reach a
              consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes. We identified a consensus
              set of six molecular classes: luminal papillary (24\%), luminal
              nonspecified (8\%), luminal unstable (15\%), stroma-rich (15\%),
              basal/squamous (35\%), and neuroendocrine-like (3\%). These
              consensus classes differ regarding underlying oncogenic
              mechanisms, infiltration by immune and stromal cells, and
              histological and clinical characteristics, including outcomes. We
              provide a single-sample classifier that assigns a consensus class
              label to a tumor sample's transcriptome. Limitations of the work
              are retrospective clinical data collection and a lack of complete
              information regarding patient treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This
              consensus system offers a robust framework that will enable
              testing and validation of predictive biomarkers in future
              prospective clinical trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: Bladder cancers are
              heterogeneous at the molecular level, and scientists have
              proposed several classifications into sets of molecular classes.
              While these classifications may be useful to stratify patients
              for prognosis or response to treatment, a consensus
              classification would facilitate the clinical use of molecular
              classes. Conducted by multidisciplinary expert teams in the
              field, this study proposes such a consensus and provides a tool

              cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to
              advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a
              powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity
              data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena
              presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine
              learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can
              result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions.
              Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate
              multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain
              the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone
              often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different
              sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate
              that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally
              complement each other to create robust predictive models that
              integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and
              explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature,
              highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions,
              and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four
              overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations,
              partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and
              theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage
              expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational
              biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics,
              experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective
              suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale
              modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help

               (exAMD) is a major cause of visual deterioration. In patients
               diagnosed with exAMD in one eye, we introduce an artificial
               intelligence (AI) system to predict progression to exAMD in the
               second eye. By combining models based on three-dimensional (3D)
               optical coherence tomography images and corresponding automatic
               tissue maps, our system predicts conversion to exAMD within a
               clinically actionable 6-month time window, achieving a
               per-volumetric-scan sensitivity of 80\% at 55\% specificity, and
               34\% sensitivity at 90\% specificity. This level of performance
               corresponds to true positives in 78\% and 41\% of individual
               eyes, and false positives in 56\% and 17\% of individual eyes at
               the high sensitivity and high specificity points, respectively.

               identify anatomical changes before conversion and high-risk
               subgroups. This AI system overcomes substantial interobserver
               variability in expert predictions, performing better than five

               expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with
               three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here,

               heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence
               tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital.
               We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation

               sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884

               produced by our architecture act as a device-independent
               representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using
               tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work

              models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task
              of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse
              and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability,

              inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the input
              data drive the decisions of the network. There are various
              real-world scenarios in which humans need to make actionable
              decisions based on the output of a decision support system that
              makes use of DNNs. These decision support systems can be found in
              critical domains, such as legislation, law enforcement, and
              healthcare. It is important that the humans making high-level
              decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by
              combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context
              of the deployment of the decision support system and that the
              decisions made are legally or ethically defensible. Due to the

              deep learning may be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal
              directions the field is taking. This complexity is further

              alleviate this problem, this article offers a ``field guide'' to
              deep learning explainability for those uninitiated in the field.

              system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii)
              places explainability in the context of other related deep

              receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this
              increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the
              notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the
              wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and
              what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to
              address these concerns by defining interpretability in the
              context of machine learning and introducing the predictive,
              descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing
              interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching
              desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive
              accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a

  abstract = "Training deep neural networks with the error backpropagation
              algorithm is considered implausible from a biological
              perspective. Numerous recent publications suggest elaborate
              models for biologically plausible variants of deep learning,
              typically defining success as reaching around 98\% test accuracy
              on the MNIST data set. Here, we investigate how far we can go on
              digit (MNIST) and object (CIFAR10) classification with
              biologically plausible, local learning rules in a network with
              one hidden layer and a single readout layer. The hidden layer
              weights are either fixed (random or random Gabor filters) or
              trained with unsupervised methods (PCA, ICA or Sparse Coding)
              that can be implemented by local learning rules. The readout
              layer is trained with a supervised, local learning rule. We first
              implement these models with rate neurons. This comparison
              reveals, first, that unsupervised learning does not lead to
              better performance than fixed random projections or Gabor filters
              for large hidden layers. Second, networks with localized
              receptive fields perform significantly better than networks with
              all-to-all connectivity and can reach backpropagation performance
              on MNIST. We then implement two of the networks - fixed,
              localized, random \& random Gabor filters in the hidden layer -
              with spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and spike timing
              dependent plasticity to train the readout layer. These spiking
              models achieve > 98.2\% test accuracy on MNIST, which is close to
              the performance of rate networks with one hidden layer trained
              with backpropagation. The performance of our shallow network
              models is comparable to most current biologically plausible
              models of deep learning. Furthermore, our results with a shallow
              spiking network provide an important reference and suggest the
              use of datasets other than MNIST for testing the performance of
              future models of biologically plausible deep learning.",

              majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here
              banishes determinants to the end of the book and focuses on the
              central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of
              linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual
              care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example,
              the book presents-without having defined determinants-a clean
              proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex
              vector space (or an odd-dimensional real vector space) has an
              eigenvalue. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter
              helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear
              algebra. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand
              for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus, the text starts by
              discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and
              dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the
              first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the
              finite-dimensional spectral theorem. This second edition includes
              a new section on orthogonal projections and minimization

               directly on ML frameworks, intermediate languages, and target

               compiled to LLVM-IR and improves performance on desired criteria

              classifiers has motivated the use of architecture search to
              discover them automatically. Although evolutionary algorithms

              image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to

              the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable
              accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered
              with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger

              well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence

              especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant

  abstract = "Recently, it has been shown that spiking neural networks (SNNs)
              can be trained efficiently, in a supervised manner, using
              backpropagation through time. Indeed, the most commonly used
              spiking neuron model, the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, obeys
              a differential equation which can be approximated using discrete
              time steps, leading to a recurrent relation for the potential.
              The firing threshold causes optimization issues, but they can be
              overcome using a surrogate gradient. Here, we extend previous
              approaches in two ways. Firstly, we show that the approach can be
              used to train convolutional layers. Convolutions can be done in
              space, time (which simulates conduction delays), or both.
              Secondly, we include fast horizontal connections \textbackslash`a
              la Den\textbackslash`eve: when a neuron N fires, we subtract to
              the potentials of all the neurons with the same receptive the dot
              product between their weight vectors and the one of neuron N. As
              Den\textbackslash`eve et al. showed, this is useful to represent
              a dynamic multidimensional analog signal in a population of
              spiking neurons. Here we demonstrate that, in addition, such
              connections also allow implementing a multidimensional
              send-on-delta coding scheme. We validate our approach on one
              speech classification benchmarks: the Google speech command

              (94\%) while maintaining low firing rates (about 5Hz). Our code

              division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of

  author   = "Lloyd, S",
  abstract = "It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM),
              with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values
              should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the
              signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by
              Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta
              becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per
              unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the
              probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In
              this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of
              quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that
              the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
              finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization
              criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a
              minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into
              the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.
              The optimum quantization schemes for 2b quanta, b = 1,2, ···, 7,

  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ($\geq$ 25) to implement. Because the majority of
              microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes,
              existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that
              our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in

              or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset.
              Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large
              datasets and minimization of I/O costs. This paper presents a
              data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing
              and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is
              especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally
              and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data
              points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the
              available resources (i.e., available memory and time
              constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a
              single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a
              few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering
              algorithm proposed in the database area to handle ``noise'' (data
              points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.
              We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order
              sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments.
              We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus

              input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is
              intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify
              it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a
              human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet
              the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose
              security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack

              those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as

               controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial
               example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals

               demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN
               with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our
               black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to
               chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local
               model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs
               synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the
               target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial
               examples, and find that they are misclassi fied by the targeted
               DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we

  abstract = "Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is the third generation of
              Artificial Neural Networks, the paradigm which fuels the current
              progress made in Artificial Intelligence. Compared to the earlier
              generations of Neural Networks, SNNs are a biologically accurate
              framework, which embodies the time characteristics of the nerve
              cells. These consider the arrival time of the presynaptic action
              potential to the postsynaptic neurone, based on which the
              synapses are weakened or strengthened, process known as
              Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). However, there has been
              little research on applying SNNs to real- life applications, and
              in this project, these artificial networks are applied to
              autonomous vehicles problem. Here we propose a system that uses a
              real-physics engine, AirSim, to simulate a car that is controlled
              by an SNN using STDP. The system uses two separate SNNs, designed
              to emulate the sensory-motor coupling and to control the steering
              and throttle of the vehicle. A circuit track was created for
              testing the system containing two types of challenges, ramps and
              road turns, for which was found that the car can drive a ramp,
              but steering in a road tun was proven to be challenging.
              Throughout these tests, the project illustrates the importance of
              using the appropriate encoding for an SNN, and the results
              suggest the potential applications of a biologically accurate
              framework for autonomous vehicles. The software designed is
              versatile, and with minor modifications, it can be applied to
              other problems. We believe that this project enhances the number
              of areas to which SNN can be utilised and lays the path for
              further research and development in using the third generation of
              Artificial Neural Networks to self-driving cars.",

              79: 2857--2874, 1998. The study was designed to reveal
              occurrences of precise firing sequences (PFSs) in cortical
              activity and to test their behavioral relevance. Two monkeys were
              trained to perform a delayed-response paradigm and to open puzzle
              boxes. Extracellular activity was recorded from neurons in
              premotor and prefrontal areas with an array of six
              microelectrodes. An algorithm was developed to detect PFSs,
              defined as a set of three spikes and two intervals with a
              precision of $\pm$1 ms repeating significantly more than expected
              by chance. The expected level of repetition was computed based on
              the firing rate and the pairwise correlation of the participating
              units, assuming a Poisson distribution of event counts.
              Accordingly, the search for PFSs was corrected for rate
              modulations. PFSs were found in 24/25 recording sessions. Most
              PFSs (76\%) were composed of spikes of more than one unit but
              usually not more than two units (67\%). The PFSs spanned hundreds
              of milliseconds, and the average interval between two events
              within the PFSs was 200 ms. No traces of periodic oscillations
              were found in the PFS intervals. The bins of the matrix that were
              defined as PFSs were isolated temporally: the spikes that
              generated PFSs were not associated with high-frequency bursts or
              rapid coherent rate fluctuations. A given PFS tended to be
              correlated with the animal's behavior. Furthermore, for 19\% of
              the PFS pairs that shared the same unit composition, each member
              of the pair was associated with a different type of behavior. The
              PFSs often appeared in clusters that were associated with
              particular phases of the behavior. The firing rate of single
              units did not provide a full explanation for the timing and
              structure of these clusters. A reduced spike train (RST) was
              defined for each unit by taking all spikes of that unit that were
              part of any PFS. In 88\% of the cases the degree of modulation of
              the RST was higher than that of the complete spike train. The
              results suggest that relevant information is carried by the fine
              temporal structure of cortical activity. A coding scheme that
              involves such temporal structures is rich and sufficiently
              flexible to facilitate a rapid organization of cortical neurons
              into functional groups. The results can be accounted for by the
              synfire chain model, which suggests that cortical activity is
              mediated by synchronous activation of neural groups in a
              reverberatory mode.",

              of the cases examined when timing jitter of 1-3 ms was allowed.
              4. An independent test refuted the hypothesis that these patterns
              represented chance events. 5. In a given behavioral condition
              there were usually many different patterns, each repeating
              several times, and not one (or a few) pattern repeating many
              times. 6. In 13 out of 20 cases, when a single unit elevated its
              firing rate in association with an external event beyond 40/s,
              most of the spikes within that period were associated with
              excessively repeating spatiotemporal patterns. 7. Of 157 types of

              process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions
              of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric
              components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges, and cones. The
              fundamental assumption of the proposed theory,
              recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of
              generalized-cone components, called geons (N $\leq$ 36), can be
              derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of
              edges in a two-dimensional image: curvature, collinearity,
              symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these
              properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image
              quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the
              image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC
              thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided
              relation between the classic principles of perceptual
              organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward
              regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object
              but the object's components. Representational power derives from
              an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of
              Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of
              object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can
              be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized
              even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or
              extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the

              might be representations of objects. The temporal continuity
              typical of objects has been used in an associative learning rule
              with a short-term memory trace to help build invariant object
              representations. In this paper, we show that spatial continuity
              can also provide a basis for helping a system to self-organize
              invariant representations. We introduce a new learning paradigm
              ``continuous transformation learning'' which operates by mapping
              spatially similar input patterns to the same postsynaptic neurons
              in a competitive learning system. As the inputs move through the
              space of possible continuous transforms (e.g. translation,
              rotation, etc.), the active synapses are modified onto the set of
              postsynaptic neurons. Because other transforms of the same
              stimulus overlap with previously learned exemplars, a common set
              of postsynaptic neurons is activated by the new transforms, and
              learning of the new active inputs onto the same postsynaptic
              neurons is facilitated. We demonstrate that a hierarchical model

  abstract = "In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of
              machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this
              approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is
              trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation.
              Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the
              resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes
              outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a
              single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological
              neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information,
              and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter.
              Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically
              realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if
              one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal
              description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in
              time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible
              local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power,
              neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs
              remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is
              usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation.
              Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to
              train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and
              computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag
              behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and
              can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many
              fewer operations and are the better candidates to process
              spatio-temporal data.",

              relearn. In a more complex environment, consisting of
              food-containers, the robot was able to learn food-container
              attraction in 95\% of trials, despite the large temporal distance
              between the correct behaviour and the reward. This is achieved by
              shifting the dopamine response from the primary stimulus (food)
              to the secondary stimulus (food-container). Our work provides
              insights into the reasons behind some observed biological

  abstract = "In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically
              comes seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an
              explanatory conundrum known as ``distal reward problem'': How
              does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are
              responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there
              when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are
              active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how
              the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking
              neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated
              by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident
              firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of
              subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the
              extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a
              few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the
              reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive
              to the ongoing activity-the key feature that distinguishes our
              approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly
              assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or
              that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This
              study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in
              brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement

  abstract = "The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical
              self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain
              dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information
              and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic
              activations after primary liquid and food rewards and
              conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They
              show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that
              resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly
              salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive
              stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with
              appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting
              and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between
              different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting
              message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
              responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on
              event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding
              events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by
              events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events
              that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to
              a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal
              characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement
              learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning
              from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may
              contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde
              action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement
              learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine
              onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global
              reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may
              improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information
              before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by
              modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is
              supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex,
              and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do
              not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation
              between the different reward signals may assure the use of
              specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the
              other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly
              serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code
              rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors
              in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive
              events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following
              dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a
              defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general
              enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus
              dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission
              of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic
              neurons.",

               firing.1. At the chemical synapse between the nociceptive
               sensory cell and the motoneurone, two opposing events occur:
               facilitation and depression. Thus, with trains of impulses, the
               synaptic potentials first increase in amplitude and then
               decrease. The two processes could be separated by altering the
               Mg and Ca content of the bathing fluid. In concentrations of Mg
               that reduced the amplitude of a single control chemical synaptic
               potential, pure facilitation occurred during a train. Depression
               predominated during brief trains in raised concentrations of Ca,
               although synaptic potentials were initially larger. These
               results suggest that changes in the amount of transmitter
               released by each presynaptic action potential can account for
               the changes observed in chemical synaptic transmission.2. In
               contrast, electrical transmission between the sensory cell
               responding to touch and the same motoneurone did not show
               facilitation or depression. The electrical coupling potential in
               the motoneurone was relatively constant when the touch cell
               fired at high or low frequencies in normal Ringer fluid, high
               Mg, or high Ca fluid.3. Further differences between chemical and
               electrical synapses were apparent when the preparation was
               cooled to 4 degrees C. In the cold the latency of chemically
               evoked synaptic potentials in the motoneurone increased and
               their amplitude declined drastically with repetitive
               stimulation, while electrical coupling potentials were
               unaffected.4. A brief hyperpolarization of the presynaptic cell
               by injected current produced a marked and prolonged increase in
               chemically evoked synaptic potentials, but did not influence
               electrical synaptic transmission.5. The synapses of the sensory
               cell responding to pressure, which are both chemical and
               electrical, behaved as expected: the chemical synaptic
               potentials showed facilitation and depression while electrical
               transmission remained relatively constant.6. These experiments
               emphasize the different functional consequences of electrical or
               chemical synapses in reflex pathways for the transmission of
               signals that arise as a result of natural sensory stimuli.",

              (BMIs), there is a great need to enable users to interact with
              changing environments during the activities of daily life. It is
              expected that the number and scope of the learning tasks
              encountered during interaction with the environment as well as
              the pattern of brain activity will vary over time. These
              conditions, in addition to neural reorganization, pose a
              challenge to decoding neural commands for BMIs. We have developed
              a new BMI framework in which a computational agent symbiotically
              decoded users' intended actions by utilizing both motor commands
              and goal information directly from the brain through a continuous
              Perception-Action-Reward Cycle (PARC). Methodology: The control
              architecture designed was based on Actor-Critic learning, which
              is a PARC-based reinforcement learning method. Our
              neurophysiology studies in rat models suggested that Nucleus
              Accumbens (NAcc) contained a rich representation of goal
              information in terms of predicting the probability of earning
              reward and it could be translated into an evaluative feedback for
              adaptation of the decoder with high precision. Simulated neural
              control experiments showed that the system was able to maintain
              high performance in decoding neural motor commands during novel
              tasks or in the presence of reorganization in the neural input.
              We then implanted a dual micro-wire array in the primary motor
              cortex (M1) and the NAcc of rat brain and implemented a full
              closed-loop system in which robot actions were decoded from the
              single unit activity in M1 based on an evaluative feedback that
              was estimated from NAcc. Conclusions: Our results suggest that
              adapting the BMI decoder with an evaluative feedback that is
              directly extracted from the brain is a possible solution to the
              problem of operating BMIs in changing environments with dynamic
              neural signals. During closed-loop control, the agent was able to
              solve a reaching task by capturing the action and reward

              the end-effector in a desired spatial direction, given the joint
              con-figuration of the arm. The spiking neurons have been
              simulated according to Izhikevich's model, which exhibits
              biologically realistic behaviour and yet is computationally
              efficient. The architecture is a feed-forward network where the
              input layers encode the intended movement direction of the
              end-effector in spatial coordinates, as well as the information
              that is given by proprioception about the current joint angles of
              the arm. The motor commands are determined by decoding the firing
              patterns in the output layers. Both excitatory and inhibitory
              synapses connect the input and output layers, and their initial
              weights are set to random values. The network learns to map input
              stimuli to motor commands during a phase of repetitive

  abstract = "Artificial neural networks are often trained by using the back
              propagation algorithm to compute the gradient of an objective
              function with respect to the synaptic strengths. For a biological
              neural network, such a gradient computation would be difficult to
              implement, because of the complex dynamics of intrinsic and
              synaptic conductances in neurons. Here we show that irregular
              spiking similar to that observed in biological neurons could be
              used as the basis for a learning rule that calculates a

              is compatible with forms of synaptic dynamics such as short-term

              performs stochastic gradient ascent on the expected reward. It is
              applied to two examples, learning the XOR computation and

  abstract = "Animals repeat rewarded behaviors, but the physiological basis of
              reward-based learning has only been partially elucidated. On one
              hand, experimental evidence shows that the neuromodulator
              dopamine carries information about rewards and affects synaptic
              plasticity. On the other hand, the theory of reinforcement
              learning provides a framework for reward-based learning. Recent
              models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity have
              made first steps towards bridging the gap between the two
              approaches, but faced two problems. First, reinforcement learning
              is typically formulated in a discrete framework, ill-adapted to
              the description of natural situations. Second, biologically
              plausible models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent
              plasticity require precise calculation of the reward prediction
              error, yet it remains to be shown how this can be computed by
              neurons. Here we propose a solution to these problems by
              extending the continuous temporal difference (TD) learning of
              Doya (2000) to the case of spiking neurons in an actor-critic
              network operating in continuous time, and with continuous state
              and action representations. In our model, the critic learns to
              predict expected future rewards in real time. Its activity,
              together with actual rewards, conditions the delivery of a
              neuromodulatory TD signal to itself and to the actor, which is
              responsible for action choice. In simulations, we show that such
              an architecture can solve a Morris water-maze-like navigation
              task, in a number of trials consistent with reported animal
              performance. We also use our model to solve the acrobot and the
              cartpole problems, two complex motor control tasks. Our model
              provides a plausible way of computing reward prediction error in
              the brain. Moreover, the analytically derived learning rule is

              actions is hierarchically organized in the cor-tex of the frontal
              lobe. In their methodologically impec-cable study, Koechlin et
              al. reveal the neural dynamics of the frontal hierarchy in
              behavioral action. Progress-ively higher areas control the
              performance of actions requiring the integration of progressively
              more complex and temporally dispersed information. The study
              sub-stantiates the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in the
              temporal organization of behavior. In 1874, the Russian
              neuroanatomist W. Betz [1] was the first to note a major
              functional dichotomy of structures along the nerve axis.
              Posterior structures are largely devoted to sensory functions,
              anterior structures to motor functions. This division of labor is
              most obvious in the spinal cord. We can also discern it in the
              cerebral cortex, however, if we expand sensory functions to
              include representations acquired through the senses and motor
              functions to include executive representations. A wealth of
              physiological and neuropsychological evidence points to a
              hierarchy of executive areas in the lateral cortex of the frontal
              lobe [2]. The primary motor and premotor areas constitute the
              lowest levels of that hierarchy. Above them in the hierarchy lie
              a series of progressively higher, anatomically more anterior
              areas of association cortex that are designated 'prefrontal'.
              Using fMRI on human subjects performing visuomotor tasks,
              Koechlin et al. [3] expose for the first time the cascading
              neurodynamics of the executive frontal hierarchy in motor action.
              Motor processing and control proceed from anterior prefrontal,
              through caudal prefrontal, to premotor cortex. At each level, the
              processing is informed by the processing at higher levels and by
              controlling sensory information which, as it moves down the
              hierarchy, is progressively simpler, more demanding of immediate
              action and less of temporal integration. The tasks of Koechlin et
              al. consisted of sequences of manual reactions to visual stimuli
              of varying complexity. The reaction to each stimulus depended on
              its visual features (e.g. color with or without a pattern
              'context') and an instructional cue that preceded the sequence to
              which that stimulus belonged. All motor reactions and the
              significance of each instructional cue were part of a set of
              rules that the subject had learned before the experi-ment. The
              key measurement was the degree of activation in anterior
              (rostral) and posterior (caudal) prefrontal cortex, and in
              premotor cortex. The authors used a computational model based on
              Shannon's information theory [4] and a hierarchical model of
              frontal organization and processing [2]. By factor analysis of
              the fMRI data, they determined that rostral prefrontal cortex
              controls behavior mainly in accordance with the instructional cue
              ('temporal episode'), caudal prefrontal cortex with the context
              of the stimulus, and premotor cortex with the stimulus itself.",

              conductance-based synapses. The neuron characteristics are
              derived from our earlier detailed models of the different
              cerebellar neurons. We tested the cerebellum model in a real-time
              control application with a robotic platform. Delays were
              introduced in the different sensorimotor pathways according to
              the biological system. The main plasticity in the cerebellar
              model is a spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at the
              parallel fiber to Purkinje cell connections. This STDP is driven
              by the inferior olive (IO) activity, which encodes an error
              signal using a novel probabilistic low frequency model. We
              demonstrate the cerebellar model in a robot control system using
              a target-reaching task. We test whether the system learns to
              reach different target positions in a non-destructive way,

  abstract = "Sensorimotor control has traditionally been considered from a
              control theory perspective, without relation to neurobiology. In
              contrast, here we utilized a spiking-neuron model of motor cortex
              and trained it to perform a simple movement task, which consisted
              of rotating a single-joint ``forearm'' to a target. Learning was
              based on a reinforcement mechanism analogous to that of the
              dopamine system. This provided a global reward or punishment
              signal in response to decreasing or increasing distance from hand
              to target, respectively. Output was partially driven by Poisson
              motor babbling, creating stochastic movements that could then be
              shaped by learning. The virtual forearm consisted of a single
              segment rotated around an elbow joint, controlled by flexor and
              extensor muscles. The model consisted of 144 excitatory and 64
              inhibitory event-based neurons, each with AMPA, NMDA, and GABA
              synapses. Proprioceptive cell input to this model encoded the 2
              muscle lengths. Plasticity was only enabled in feedforward
              connections between input and output excitatory units, using
              spike-timing-dependent eligibility traces for synaptic credit or
              blame assignment. Learning resulted from a global 3-valued
              signal: reward (+1), no learning (0), or punishment (-1),
              corresponding to phasic increases, lack of change, or phasic
              decreases of dopaminergic cell firing, respectively. Successful
              learning only occurred when both reward and punishment were
              enabled. In this case, 5 target angles were learned successfully
              within 180 s of simulation time, with a median error of 8
              degrees. Motor babbling allowed exploratory learning, but
              decreased the stability of the learned behavior, since the hand
              continued moving after reaching the target. Our model
              demonstrated that a global reinforcement signal, coupled with
              eligibility traces for synaptic plasticity, can train a spiking
              sensorimotor network to perform goal-directed motor behavior.",

              applications with acceptable performance. At the same time, based
              on the traditional CMOS technology, the efficiency of SNN systems
              is also unsatisfactory. In this work, we explore different
              training algorithms of SNN for real-world applications, and
              demonstrate that the Neural Sampling method is much more
              effective than Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and
              Remote Supervision Method (ReSuMe). We also propose an energy
              efficient implementation of SNN with the emerging metal-oxide
              resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices, which includes an
              RRAM crossbar array works as network synapses, an analog design

              91.2\% accuracy on the MNIST dataset with an ultra-low power

              populations, while single-neurons are deemed unreliable and
              redundant. Here we challenge this view and show that many
              single-neuron quantities, including voltages, firing thresholds,

              error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically plausible
              local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks
              implementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of
              number of neurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from
              rate models. Finally, these networks should be robust to noise
              and neural deaths in order to sustain these representations in
              the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We approach
              this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking

              learning rules are ensured by feeding back into the network its

              of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation
              environments presently available (restricted to those freely
              available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool,
              its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow
              the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given
              task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of
              different types of networks of spiking neurons, including
              Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with
              current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven
              or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models
              are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are
              made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a
              resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration
              strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem

              advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research
              have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation.
              Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural
              networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action
              for biological brains. This approach has the potential to
              radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems,
              because the computations performed by deep networks are learned
              from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how
              can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand
              biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who
              seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to
              understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions?
              In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems

              The increasing availability of tumor data allows to research the

              large available repositories of high dimensional tumor samples
              characterised with germline and somatic mutation data requires
              advance computational modelling for data interpretation. In this
              work, we propose to analyze this complex data with neural network
              learning, a methodology that made impressive advances in image
              and natural language processing. RESULTS: Here we present a tumor
              mutation profile analysis pipeline based on an autoencoder model,
              which is used to discover better representations of lower

              revealed, the mechanism of tumourigenesis has yet to be
              completely understood. Pathways and networks are important tools
              to explain the role of genes in functional genomic studies.
              However, few methods consider the functional non-equal roles of
              genes in pathways and the complex gene-gene interactions in a
              network. RESULTS: We present a novel method in pan-cancer
              analysis that identifies de-regulated genes with a functional
              role by integrating pathway and network data. A pan-cancer
              analysis of 7158 tumour/normal samples from 16 cancer types

              1) confirmed that there are several known cancer driver genes in

               adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, kidney renal papillary cell
               carcinoma, low grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous
               cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and
               uterine corpus endometriod carcinoma. Signaling Pathway Impact
               Analysis (SPIA) is a software package that analyzes gene
               expression data to identify whether a pathway is relevant in a
               given condition. METHODS: We present the results of a study that
               uses SPIA to investigate all 157 signaling pathways in the KEGG
               PATHWAY database. We analyzed each of the ten cancer types
               mentioned above separately, and we perform a pan-cancer analysis
               by grouping the data for all the cancer types. RESULTS: In each
               analysis several pathways were found to be markedly more
               significant than all the other pathways. We call them notable.
               Research has already established a connection between many of
               these pathways and the corresponding cancer type. However, some
               of our discovered pathways appear to be new findings. Altogether
               there were 37 notable findings in the separate analyses, 26 of
               them occurred in 7 pathways. These 7 pathways included the 4
               notable pathways discovered in the pan-cancer analysis. So, our
               results suggest that these 7 pathways account for much of the
               mechanisms of cancer. Furthermore, by looking at the overlap
               among pathways, we identified possible regions on the pathways
               where the aberrant activity is occurring. CONCLUSIONS: We
               obtained 37 notable findings concerning 18 pathways. Some of
               them appear to be new discoveries. Furthermore, we identified
               regions on pathways where the aberrant activity might be
               occurring. We conclude that our results will prove to be
               valuable to cancer researchers because they provide many
               opportunities for laboratory and clinical follow-up studies.",

              and targeted therapeutics of cancer is to comprehensively
              understand its molecular mechanisms. Large-scale cancer genomics
              projects are providing a large volume of data about genomic,
              epigenomic and gene expression aberrations in multiple cancer
              types. One of the remaining challenges is to identify driver
              mutations, driver genes and driver pathways promoting cancer
              proliferation and filter out the unfunctional and passenger ones.
              RESULTS: In this study, we propose two methods to solve the
              so-called maximum weight submatrix problem, which is designed to
              de novo identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in
              cancer. The first one is an exact method that can be helpful for
              assessing other approximate or/and heuristic algorithms. The
              second one is a stochastic and flexible method that can be
              employed to incorporate other types of information to improve the
              first method. Particularly, we propose an integrative model to
              combine mutation and expression data. We first apply our methods
              onto simulated data to show their efficiency. We further apply
              the proposed methods onto several real biological datasets, such
              as the mutation profiles of 74 head and neck squamous cell
              carcinomas samples, 90 glioblastoma tumor samples and 313 ovarian
              carcinoma samples. The gene expression profiles were also
              considered for the later two data. The results show that our
              integrative model can identify more biologically relevant gene
              sets. We have implemented all these methods and made a package

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and
              aggressive type of brain tumor in humans and the first cancer
              with comprehensive genomic profiles mapped by The Cancer Genome
              Atlas (TCGA) project. A central challenge in large-scale genome
              projects, such as the TCGA GBM project, is the ability to
              distinguish cancer-causing ``driver'' mutations from passively
              selected ``passenger'' mutations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In contrast
              to a purely frequency based approach to identifying driver
              mutations in cancer, we propose an automated network-based
              approach for identifying candidate oncogenic processes and driver
              genes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular
              networks contain functional modules, and that tumors target
              specific modules critical to their growth. Key elements in the
              approach include combined analysis of sequence mutations and DNA
              copy number alterations; use of a unified molecular interaction
              network consisting of both protein-protein interactions and
              signaling pathways; and identification and statistical assessment
              of network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of interest
              with a higher density of interactions within groups than between
              groups. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm and extend the observation that
              GBM alterations tend to occur within specific functional modules,
              in spite of considerable patient-to-patient variation, and that
              two of the largest modules involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K
              and receptor protein kinases. We also identify new candidate
              drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative oncogene and
              an activator of the PI3K pathway; and, three additional

              surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to
              occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that
              affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient.
              While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer
              genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is
              incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have
              developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer
              (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical
              tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member
              genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2)
              member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the
              same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the
              modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA), the method identifies the principal known
              altered modules in glioblastoma (GBM) and highlights the striking
              mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and
              Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel
              observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually
              exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of RB1,
              suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in
              this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene
              involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any
              cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic
              alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and
              may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in

              widely used ORA tools employ statistical methods such as Fisher's
              exact test that reduce a pathway into a list of genes, ignoring
              the constitutive functional non-equivalent roles of genes and the

              named LEGO (functional Link Enrichment of Gene Ontology or gene

              interest. Such tools are frequently used in gene-centric
              approaches derived from RNA-sequencing or microarrays such as
              Ingenuity or GSEA, but they have also been adapted for
              interval-based analysis derived from DNA methylation or
              ChIP/ATAC-sequencing. Gene-set analysis tools return, as a
              result, a list of significant gene-sets. However, while these
              results are useful for the researcher in the identification of
              major biological insights, they may be complex to interpret
              because many gene-sets have largely overlapping gene contents.
              Additionally, in many cases the result of gene-set analysis

              identified gene-sets, from one or multiple experiments and/or
              tools, based on shared genes. GeneSetCluster calculates a
              distance score based on overlapping gene content, which is then
              used to cluster them together and as a result, GeneSetCluster
              identifies groups of gene-sets with similar gene-set definitions

  abstract = "Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are enabling
              genome-wide measurements of somatic mutations in large numbers of
              cancer patients. A major challenge in the interpretation of these
              data is to distinguish functional ``driver mutations'' important
              for cancer development from random ``passenger mutations.'' A
              common approach for identifying driver mutations is to find genes
              that are mutated at significant frequency in a large cohort of
              cancer genomes. This approach is confounded by the observation
              that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways. Thus, each cancer patient may exhibit a
              different combination of mutations that are sufficient to perturb
              these pathways. This mutational heterogeneity presents a problem
              for predicting driver mutations solely from their frequency of
              occurrence. We introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage
              and exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of
              genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with
              passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix, to
              find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We apply
              Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes in 188
              lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84 glioblastoma
              patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000 patients with various
              cancers. In all data sets, we find groups of genes that are
              mutated in large subsets of patients and whose mutations are
              approximately exclusive. Our Dendrix algorithms scale to
              whole-genome analysis of thousands of patients and thus will
              prove useful for larger data sets to come from The Cancer Genome

              titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that
              overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems
              largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel
              analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We
              apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs
              and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and
              spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational
              processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across
              the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
              timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating
              mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to
              eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable
              the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.",

              alterations that determine clinical phenotypes, such as survival
              time or drug response. Somatic mutations in cancer are typically
              very diverse, and are found in different sets of genes in
              different patients. This mutational heterogeneity complicates the
              discovery of associations between individual mutations and a
              clinical phenotype. This mutational heterogeneity is explained in
              part by the fact that driver mutations, the somatic mutations
              that drive cancer development, target genes in cellular pathways,
              and only a subset of pathway genes is mutated in a given patient.
              Thus, pathway-based analysis of associations between mutations
              and phenotype are warranted. Here, we introduce an algorithm to
              find groups of genes, or pathways, whose mutational status is
              associated to a clinical phenotype without prior definition of
              the pathways. Rather, we find subnetworks of genes in an gene
              interaction network with the property that the mutational status
              of the genes in the subnetwork are significantly associated with
              a clinical phenotype. This new algorithm is built upon HotNet, an
              algorithm that finds groups of mutated genes using a heat

              genes causally implicated in oncogenesis is challenging because
              the gain or loss of a chromosomal region may affect a few key
              driver genes and many passengers. Integrative analyses have
              opened new vistas for addressing this issue. One approach is to
              identify genes with frequent copy number alterations and
              corresponding changes in expression. Several methods also analyse
              effects of transcriptional changes on known pathways. Here, we
              propose a method that analyses in-cis correlated genes for
              evidence of in-trans association to biological processes, with no
              bias towards processes of a particular type or function. The
              method aims to identify cis-regulated genes for which the
              expression correlation to other genes provides further evidence
              of a network-perturbing role in cancer. The proposed unsupervised
              approach involves a sequence of statistical tests to
              systematically narrow down the list of relevant genes, based on
              integrative analysis of copy number and gene expression data. A
              novel adjustment method handles confounding effects of
              co-occurring copy number aberrations, potentially a large source
              of false positives in such studies. Applying the method to
              whole-genome copy number and expression data from 100 primary
              breast carcinomas, 6373 genes were identified as commonly
              aberrant, 578 were highly in-cis correlated, and 56 were in
              addition associated in-trans to biological processes. Among these
              in-trans process associated and cis-correlated (iPAC) genes, 28\%
              have previously been reported as breast cancer associated, and
              64\% as cancer associated. By combining statistical evidence from
              three separate subanalyses that focus respectively on copy
              number, gene expression and the combination of the two, the
              proposed method identifies several known and novel cancer driver
              candidates. Validation in an independent data set supports the
              conclusion that the method identifies genes implicated in cancer.",

              efforts to distinguish functional mutations from sporadic,
              passenger mutations. Since cancer mutations are hypothesized to
              target a relatively small number of cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways, a common practice is to assess whether known
              pathways are enriched for mutated genes. We introduce an
              alternative approach that examines mutated genes in the context
              of a genome-scale gene interaction network. We present a
              computationally efficient strategy for de novo identification of
              subnetworks in an interaction network that are mutated in a
              statistically significant number of patients. This framework

              on the interaction network to define a local neighborhood of
              ``influence'' for each mutated gene in the network. Second, we
              derive a two-stage multiple hypothesis test to bound the false
              discovery rate (FDR) associated with the identified subnetworks.
              We test these algorithms on a large human protein-protein

              The algorithm relies on two combinatorial properties of mutations

              derive an integer linear program that finds set of mutations

  abstract = "In large collections of tumor samples, it has been observed that
              sets of genes that are commonly involved in the same cancer
              pathways tend not to occur mutated together in the same patient.
              Such gene sets form mutually exclusive patterns of gene
              alterations in cancer genomic data. Computational approaches that
              detect mutually exclusive gene sets, rank and test candidate
              alteration patterns by rewarding the number of samples the
              pattern covers and by punishing its impurity, i.e., additional
              alterations that violate strict mutual exclusivity. However, the
              extant approaches do not account for possible observation errors.
              In practice, false negatives and especially false positives can
              severely bias evaluation and ranking of alteration patterns. To
              address these limitations, we develop a fully probabilistic,
              generative model of mutual exclusivity, explicitly taking
              coverage, impurity, as well as error rates into account, and
              devise efficient algorithms for parameter estimation and pattern
              ranking. Based on this model, we derive a statistical test of
              mutual exclusivity by comparing its likelihood to the null model
              that assumes independent gene alterations. Using extensive
              simulations, the new test is shown to be more powerful than a
              permutation test applied previously. When applied to detect
              mutual exclusivity patterns in glioblastoma and in pan-cancer

              patterns that are biologically relevant, most of which would not

               characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly
               to the research community. Here we report the interim
               integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA
               methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common
               type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations
               in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new
               insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers
               frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase
               regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of
               the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma.
               Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and
               clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter
               methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch
               repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with
               potential clinical implications. Together, these findings
               establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that

                   argue that a wide range of goals can be meaningfully taken

               brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act
               upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks
               have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic
               weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in
               real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple,

               rather, they use local computations to interpolate over
               task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space.
               Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes,
               over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as
               they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse

                   representation of something, or claim to have found evidence
                   for a neural representation. But what do these statements
                   mean? The reasons to call some neural activity a
                   representation and the assumptions that come with this term
                   are not generally made clear from its common uses in
                   neuroscience. Representation is a central concept in
                   philosophy of mind, with a rich history going back to the
                   ancient period. In order to clarify its usage in
                   neuroscience, here we advance a link between the
                   connotations of this term across these disciplines. We draw
                   on a broad range of discourse in philosophy to distinguish
                   three key aspects of representation: correspondence,
                   functional role, and teleology. We argue that each of these
                   aspects are implied by the explanatory role the term plays
                   in neuroscience. However, evidence related to all three
                   aspects is rarely presented or discussed in the course of
                   individual studies that aim to identify representations.
                   Overlooking the significance of all three aspects hinders
                   communication in neuroscience, as it obscures the
                   limitations of experimental paradigms and conceals gaps in
                   our understanding of the phenomena of primary interest.
                   Working from this three-part view, we discuss how to move
                   toward clearer communication about representations in the

               collect biomedical omics datasets. It is usually possible to
               obtain multiple types of omics data from a single patient
               sample. Clustering of omics data plays an indispensable role in
               biological and medical research, and it is helpful to reveal
               data structures from multiple collections. Nevertheless,
               clustering of omics data consists of many challenges. The
               primary challenges in omics data analysis come from high
               dimension of data and small size of sample. Therefore, it is
               difficult to find a suitable integration method for structural
               analysis of multiple datasets. In this paper, a multi-view
               clustering based on Stiefel manifold method (MCSM) is proposed.
               The MCSM method comprises three core steps. Firstly, we
               established a binary optimization model for the simultaneous
               clustering problem. Secondly, we solved the optimization problem
               by linear search algorithm based on Stiefel manifold. Finally,
               we integrated the clustering results obtained from three omics
               by using k-nearest neighbor method. We applied this approach to
               four cancer datasets on TCGA. The result shows that our method
               is superior to several state-of-art methods, which depends on
               the hypothesis that the underlying omics cluster class is the
               same. Particularly, our approach has better performance than
               compared approaches when the underlying clusters are
               inconsistent. For patients with different subtypes, both
               consistent and differential clusters can be identified at the

              artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning. In
              addition, the cost reduction in large scale next-generation
              sequencing, and the availability of such data through open source
              databases (e.g., TCGA and GEO databases) offer us opportunities
              to possibly build more powerful and accurate models to predict
              cancer prognosis more accurately. In this review, we reviewed the
              most recent published works that used deep learning to build
              models for cancer prognosis prediction. Deep learning has been
              suggested to be a more generic model, requires less data
              engineering, and achieves more accurate prediction when working
              with large amounts of data. The application of deep learning in
              cancer prognosis has been shown to be equivalent or better than
              current approaches, such as Cox-PH. With the burst of multi-omics
              data, including genomics data, transcriptomics data and clinical
              information in cancer studies, we believe that deep learning
              would potentially improve cancer prognosis.",

  abstract      = "Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve
                   different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either
                   careful feature engineering, or a significant number of
                   samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots
                   should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any
                   given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of
                   the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering.
                   In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for
                   achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation
                   learning. Specifically, we consider the setting where there
                   is a very large set of tasks, and each task has many
                   instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all
                   blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be
                   to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc.
                   In each case, different instances of the task would consist
                   of different sets of blocks with different initial states.
                   At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of
                   demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is
                   trained that takes as input one demonstration and the
                   current state (which initially is the initial state of the
                   other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with
                   the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions
                   matches as closely as possible with the second
                   demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a single
                   instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is
                   expected to perform well on new instances of this new task.
                   The use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to
                   conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We
                   anticipate that by training this model on a much greater
                   variety of tasks and settings, we will obtain a general
                   system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies
                   that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks. Videos

              and understand the relationships between patients' covariates
              (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of
              various treatment options. Standard survival models like the
              linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature
              engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment
              interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival
              methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can
              inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have
              yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems.
              METHODS: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep
              neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling
              interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment
              effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment
              recommendations. RESULTS: We perform a number of experiments
              training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We
              demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than
              other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv
              successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a
              patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how
              DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and
              effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv
              can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations.
              Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to
              demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would
              increase the survival time of a set of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
              predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable

              proportional hazards models are trained with transcriptomic data
              to predict survival outcomes in cancer patients. METHODS: In this
              study, a broad analysis was performed on TCGA cancers using a
              variety of Deep Learning-based models, including Cox-nnet,
              DeepSurv, and a method proposed by our group named AECOX
              (AutoEncoder with Cox regression network). Concordance index and
              p-value of the log-rank test are used to evaluate the model
              performances. RESULTS: All models show competitive results across
              12 cancer types. The last hidden layers of the Deep Learning
              approaches are lower dimensional representations of the input
              data that can be used for feature reduction and visualization.

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate
                   samples of news articles which human evaluators have
                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.
                   We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Comprehensive molecular profiling of various cancers
              and other diseases has generated vast amounts of multi-omics
              data. Each type of -omics data corresponds to one feature space,
              such as gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, etc.
              Integrating multi-omics data can link different layers of
              molecular feature spaces and is crucial to elucidate molecular
              pathways underlying various diseases. Machine learning approaches
              to mining multi-omics data hold great promises in uncovering
              intricate relationships among molecular features. However, due to
              the ``big p, small n'' problem (i.e., small sample sizes with
              high-dimensional features), training a large-scale generalizable
              deep learning model with multi-omics data alone is very
              challenging. RESULTS: We developed a method called Multi-view
              Factorization AutoEncoder (MAE) with network constraints that can
              seamlessly integrate multi-omics data and domain knowledge such
              as molecular interaction networks. Our method learns feature and
              patient embeddings simultaneously with deep representation
              learning. Both feature representations and patient
              representations are subject to certain constraints specified as
              regularization terms in the training objective. By incorporating
              domain knowledge into the training objective, we implicitly
              introduced a good inductive bias into the machine learning model,
              which helps improve model generalizability. We performed
              extensive experiments on the TCGA datasets and demonstrated the
              power of integrating multi-omics data and biological interaction
              networks using our proposed method for predicting target clinical
              variables. CONCLUSIONS: To alleviate the overfitting problem in
              deep learning on multi-omics data with the ``big p, small n''
              problem, it is helpful to incorporate biological domain knowledge
              into the model as inductive biases. It is very promising to
              design machine learning models that facilitate the seamless
              integration of large-scale multi-omics data and biomedical domain
              knowledge for uncovering intricate relationships among molecular
              features and clinical features.",

              In this study, we implement Deep Learning-based networks to
              determine how gene expression data predicts Cox regression

              article, we compare a panel of 13 unsupervised methods based on
              these different approaches to integrate various types of
              multi-omics datasets: iClusterPlus, regularized generalized
              canonical correlation analysis, sparse generalized canonical

              recover the subgroups and the variables that drive the clustering
              on eight benchmarks of simulation. MOFA does not provide any
              results on these benchmarks. For clustering, SNF, MoCluster,
              CIMLR, LRAcluster, ConsensusClustering and intNMF provide the
              best results. For variable selection, MoCluster outperforms the

              on the heterogeneity of the datasets (especially for MCIA, intNMF

              individual cells to be profiled with high accuracy. An essential
              task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of cell
              types from complex samples or tissues profiled in an experiment.
              To this end, clustering has become a key computational technique
              for grouping cells based on their transcriptome profiles,
              enabling subsequent cell type identification from each cluster of
              cells. Due to the high feature-dimensionality of the
              transcriptome (i.e. the large number of measured genes in each
              cell) and because only a small fraction of genes are cell
              type-specific and therefore informative for generating cell
              type-specific clusters, clustering directly on the original
              feature/gene dimension may lead to uninformative clusters and
              hinder correct cell type identification. RESULTS: Here, we
              propose an autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework in which
              we first take random subspace projections from the data, then
              compress each random projection to a low-dimensional space using
              an autoencoder artificial neural network, and finally apply
              ensemble clustering across all encoded datasets to generate
              clusters of cells. We employ four evaluation metrics to benchmark
              clustering performance and our experiments demonstrate that the
              proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble can lead to
              substantially improved cell type-specific clusters when applied
              with both the standard k-means clustering algorithm and a
              state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR)
              designed specifically for scRNA-seq data. Compared to directly
              using these clustering algorithms on the original datasets, the
              performance improvement in some cases is up to 100\%, depending
              on the evaluation metric used. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
              that the proposed framework can facilitate more accurate cell
              type identification as well as other downstream analyses. The
              code for creating the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble
              framework is freely available from

  abstract  = "Omics data are normally high dimensional with large number of
               molecular features and relatively small number of available
               samples with clinical labels. The ``curse of dimensionality''
               makes it challenging to train a machine learning model using
               high dimensional omics data like DNA methylation and gene
               expression profiles. Here we propose an end-to-end deep learning
               model called OmiVAE to extract low dimensional features and
               classify samples from multi-omics data. OmiVAE combines the
               basic structure of variational autoencoders with a classifier to
               achieve task-oriented feature extraction and multi-class
               classification. The training procedure of OmiVAE is comprised of
               an unsupervised phase and a supervised phase. During the
               unsupervised phase, a hierarchical cluster structure of samples
               can be automatically formed without the need for labels. And in
               the supervised phase, OmiVAE achieved an average accuracy of
               97.49\% after 10-fold cross-validation among 33 tumour types and
               normal samples, which shows better performance than existing
               methods. The integrated model learned from multi-omics datasets
               outperformed those using only one type of omics data, which
               indicates that the complementary information from different
               omics datatypes provides useful insights for biomedical tasks
               like cancer classification.",

  abstract = "Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma
              (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently,
              endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict
              HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill
              this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)-based model on HCC that
              robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in
              six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on
              360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA
              sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an
              alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both
              considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of
              patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e-6) and
              good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More
              aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation
              mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and
              EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt
              signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five
              external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n =
              230, C-index = 0.75), NCI cohort (n = 221, C-index = 0.67),
              Chinese cohort (n = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n =
              40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n = 27, C-index =
              0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify
              multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of
              patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we
              expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis

  abstract = "The identification of cancer subtypes is vital to advance the
              precision of cancer disease diagnosis and therapy. Several works
              had been done to integrate multiple types of genomics data to
              investigate cancer subtypes. However, (1) few of them
              particularly considered the intrinsic correlations in each type
              of data; (2) to the best of our knowledge, none of them
              considered transcriptome alternative splicing regulation in data
              integration. It has been demonstrated that many cancers are
              related to abnormal alternative splicing regulations in recent
              years. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep learning
              framework, HI-SAE, to integrate gene expression and transcriptome
              alternative splicing profiles data to identify cancer subtypes.
              We adopt the stacked autoencoder (SAE) neural network to learn
              high-level representations in each type of data, respectively,
              and then integrate all the learned high-level representations by
              another learning layer to learn more complex data
              representations. Based on the final learned data representations,
              we cluster patients into different cancer subtype groups.
              Comprehensive experiments based on TCGA breast cancer data
              demonstrate that our model provides an effective and useful
              approach to integrate multiple types of transcriptomics data to
              identify cancer subtypes and the transcriptome alternative

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bioinformatics tools have been developed to interpret
              gene expression data at the gene set level, and these gene set
              based analyses improve the biologists' capability to discover
              functional relevance of their experiment design. While
              elucidating gene set individually, inter-gene sets association is
              rarely taken into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging
              machine learning technique in computational biology, can be used
              to generate an unbiased combination of gene set, and to determine
              the biological relevance and analysis consistency of these
              combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets.
              RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a gene superset autoencoder
              (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model with the incorporation of
              a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial biological
              features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the
              gene superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights
              trained by the autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer
              is a superset. Trained with genomic data from TCGA and evaluated
              with their accompanying clinical parameters, we showed gene
              supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes and their
              prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological
              relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant
              supersets. CONCLUSIONS: Using autoencoder model and gene superset
              at its latent layer, we demonstrated that gene supersets retain
              sufficient biological information with respect to tumor subtypes
              and clinical prognostic significance. Superset also provides high

  abstract = "Background: Muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) cause
              approximately 150 000 deaths per year worldwide. Survival for
              MIBC patients is heterogeneous, with no clinically validated
              molecular markers that predict clinical outcome. Non-MIBCs
              (NMIBCs) generally have favorable outcome; however, a portion
              progress to MIBC. Hence, development of a prognostic tool that
              can guide decision-making is crucial for improving clinical
              management of bladder urothelial carcinomas. Methods: Tumor grade
              is defined by pathologic evaluation of tumor cell
              differentiation, and it often associates with clinical outcome.
              The current study extrapolates this conventional wisdom and
              combines it with molecular profiling. We developed an 18-gene
              signature that molecularly defines urothelial cellular
              differentiation, thus classifying MIBCs and NMIBCs into two
              subgroups: basal and differentiated. We evaluated the prognostic
              capability of this ``tumor differentiation signature'' and three
              other existing gene signatures including the The Cancer Genome
              Atlas (TCGA; 2707 genes), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA; 2252
              genes/2697 probes), and University of North Carolina at Chapel
              Hill (UNC; 47 genes) using five gene expression data sets derived
              from MIBC and NMIBC patients. All statistical tests were
              two-sided. Results: The tumor differentiation signature
              demonstrated consistency and statistical robustness toward
              stratifying MIBC patients into different overall survival
              outcomes (TCGA cohort 1, P = .03; MDA discovery, P = .009; MDA
              validation, P = .01), while the other signatures were not as
              consistent. In addition, we analyzed the progression (Ta/T1
              progressing to $\geq$T2) probability of NMIBCs. NMIBC patients
              with a basal tumor differentiation signature associated with
              worse progression outcome (P = .008). Gene functional term
              enrichment and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that genes
              involved in the biologic process of immune response and
              inflammatory response are among the most elevated within basal
              bladder cancers, implicating them as candidates for immune
              checkpoint therapies. Conclusions: These results provide
              definitive evidence that a biology-prioritizing clustering

              biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge
              number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and
              disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al.,
              2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI)
              at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly
              140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project
              (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development
              software project built in the R statistical programming
              environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and
              comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the
              BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for
              the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a
              software tool that allows access to the wealth of information
              within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the
              formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses
              labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery,
              effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor.
              Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new
              analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and
              bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of
              microarray data will increase the efficiency with which
              biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published
              genomic data. AVAILABILITY: GEOquery is available as part of the

              defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and
              ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16\% of all
              breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time
              of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum
              of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding
              somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain
              hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA
              sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36\% of
              mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of
              allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for
              the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype,
              the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases
              representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely
              in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the
              basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC.
              Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic
              mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes,
              in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with
              founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and
              motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies,
              suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression.
              Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology
              and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the
              determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.",

              the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining
              proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
              cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
              angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
              these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the
              genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and
              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging
              hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of
              energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to
              cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity:
              they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells
              that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating
              the ``tumor microenvironment.'' Recognition of the widespread

              pace over the last five years as sequencing costs continue to
              drop and numerous molecular assays have been coupled to
              sequencing readouts. This rapid period of technological
              development has facilitated the delineation of individual
              molecular characteristics including the genome, transcriptome,
              epigenome, and proteome of individual cells, leading to an
              unprecedented resolution of the molecular networks governing
              complex biological systems. The immense power of single-cell
              molecular screens has been particularly highlighted through work
              in systems where cellular heterogeneity is a key feature, such as
              stem cell biology, immunology, and tumor cell biology.
              Single-cell-omics technologies have already contributed to the
              identification of novel disease biomarkers, cellular subsets,
              therapeutic targets and diagnostics, many of which would have
              been undetectable by bulk sequencing approaches. More recently,
              efforts to integrate single-cell multi-omics with single cell
              functional output and/or physical location have been challenging
              but have led to substantial advances. Perhaps most excitingly,
              there are emerging opportunities to reach beyond the description
              of static cellular states with recent advances in modulation of
              cells through CRISPR technology, in particular with the

              developments in integrating single-cell molecular screens and
              performing single-cell multi-omics for clinical applications. We

              combined with functional data to unpick the mechanism of cellular
              decision-making. Finally, we reflect upon the introduction of
              spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, its complementary role

                   macroscopic variables associated with highly-multivariate
                   microscopic dynamical processes, in the context of a coupled
                   dynamical environment. Dynamical independence instantiates
                   the intuition of an emergent macroscopic process as one
                   possessing the characteristics of a dynamical system ``in
                   its own right'', with its own dynamical laws distinct from
                   those of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We quantify
                   (departure from) dynamical independence by a
                   transformation-invariant Shannon information-based measure
                   of dynamical dependence. We emphasise the data-driven
                   discovery of dynamically-independent macroscopic variables,
                   and introduce the idea of a multiscale ``emergence
                   portrait'' for complex systems. We show how dynamical
                   dependence may be computed explicitly for linear systems via
                   state-space modelling, in both time and frequency domains,
                   facilitating discovery of emergent phenomena at all
                   spatiotemporal scales. We discuss application of the
                   state-space operationalisation to inference of the emergence
                   portrait for neural systems from neurophysiological
                   time-series data. We also examine dynamical independence for
                   discrete- and continuous-time deterministic dynamics, with
                   potential application to Hamiltonian mechanics and classical
                   complex systems such as flocking and cellular automata.",

@ARTICLE{Shadmehr2020-rd,
  title    = "Population coding in the cerebellum: a machine learning
              perspective",
  author   = "Shadmehr, Reza",
  abstract = "The cere resembles a feedforward, three-layer network of neurons
              in which the ``hidden layer'' consists of Purkinje cells
              (P-cells) and the output layer consists of deep cerebellar
              nucleus (DCN) neurons. In this analogy, the output of each DCN
              neuron is a prediction that is compared with the actual
              observation, resulting in an error signal that originates in the
              inferior olive. Efficient learning requires that the error signal
              reach the DCN neurons, as well as the P-cells that project onto
              them. However, this basic rule of learning is violated in the
              cerebellum: the olivary projections to the DCN are weak,
              particularly in adulthood. Instead, an extraordinarily strong
              signal is sent from the olive to the P-cells, producing complex
              spikes. Curiously, P-cells are grouped into small populations
              that converge onto single DCN neurons. Why are the P-cells
              organized in this way, and what is the membership criterion of
              each population? Here, I apply elementary mathematics from
              machine learning and consider the fact that P-cells that form a
              population exhibit a special property: they can synchronize their
              complex spikes, which in turn suppress activity of DCN neuron
              they project to. Thus complex spikes cannot only act as a
              teaching signal for a P-cell, but through complex spike
              synchrony, a P-cell population may act as a surrogate teacher for
              the DCN neuron that produced the erroneous output. It appears
              that grouping of P-cells into small populations that share a
              preference for error satisfies a critical requirement of
              efficient learning: providing error information to the output
              layer neuron (DCN) that was responsible for the error, as well as
              the hidden layer neurons (P-cells) that contributed to it. This
              population coding may account for several remarkable features of
              behavior during learning, including multiple timescales,
              protection from erasure, and spontaneous recovery of memory.",

               variable clinical outcomes. Here, we perform an integrative
               multi-omics analysis of patients diagnosed with NMIBC (n = 834).
               Transcriptomic analysis identifies four classes (1, 2a, 2b and
               3) reflecting tumor biology and disease aggressiveness. Both
               transcriptome-based subtyping and the level of chromosomal
               instability provide independent prognostic value beyond
               established prognostic clinicopathological parameters. High
               chromosomal instability, p53-pathway disruption and
               APOBEC-related mutations are significantly associated with
               transcriptomic class 2a and poor outcome. RNA-derived immune
               cell infiltration is associated with chromosomally unstable
               tumors and enriched in class 2b. Spatial proteomics analysis
               confirms the higher infiltration of class 2b tumors and
               demonstrates an association between higher immune cell
               infiltration and lower recurrence rates. Finally, the
               independent prognostic value of the transcriptomic classes is
               documented in 1228 validation samples using a single sample
               classification tool. The classifier provides a framework for

                   input-output examples without any explicit model training.
                   In this work, we study how effectively transformers can
                   bridge between their pretraining data mixture, comprised of
                   multiple distinct task families, to identify and learn new
                   tasks in-context which are both inside and outside the

              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. RESULTS: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers

              Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of
              around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
              sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months
              to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
              protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
              to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
              bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will
              adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure
              prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been
              an important open research problem for more than 50 years9.
              Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of
              atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is

              can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy

              changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures and
              localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new
              approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and
              used data from new genome mapping technologies and single
              haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly
              issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains
              sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also
              expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that
              provides a more robust representation of human population
              variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference
              an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in
              unchanged regions and impact variant interpretation at clinically
              relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de
              novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that while the new
              assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to
              continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference
              still provides the best representation for complex genomic
              regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected
              updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate
              for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of
              human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.",

              cancer represents an area of considerable research which has been
              tested in both patients presenting with haematuria and non-muscle
              invasive bladder cancer patients requiring surveillance
              cystoscopy. In this systematic review, we identify and appraise
              the diagnostic sensitive and specificity of reported novel
              biomarkers of different 'omic' class and highlight promising
              biomarkers investigated to date. METHODS: A MEDLINE/Pubmed
              systematic search was performed between January 2013 and July
              2017 using the following keywords: (bladder cancer OR
              transitional cell carcinoma OR urothelial cell carcinoma) AND
              (detection OR diagnosis) AND urine AND (biomarker OR assay). All
              studies had a minimum of 20 patients in both bladder cancer and
              control arms and reported sensitivity and/or specificity and/or
              receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. QUADAS-2 tool was
              used to assess risk of bias and applicability of studies. The
              search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database
              (CRD42016049918). RESULTS: Systematic search yielded 115 reports
              were included for analysis. In single target biomarkers had a
              sensitivity of 2-94\%, specificity of 46-100\%, positive
              predictive value (PPV) of 47-100\% and negative predictive value
              (NPV) of 21-94\%. Multi-target biomarkers achieved a sensitivity
              of 24-100\%, specificity of 48-100\%, PPV of 42-95\% and NPV of
              32-100\%. 50 studies achieved a sensitivity and specificity of
              $\geq$80\%. Protein (n = 59) and transcriptomic (n = 21)
              biomarkers represents the most studied biomarkers. Multi-target
              biomarker panels had a better diagnostic accuracy compared to
              single biomarker targets. Urinary cytology with urinary
              biomarkers improved the diagnostic ability of the biomarker. The
              sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers were higher for primary
              diagnosis compared to patients in the surveillance setting. Most
              studies were case control studies and did not have a predefined
              threshold to determine a positive test result indicating a
              possible risk of bias. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive systematic
              review provides an update on urinary biomarkers of different
              'omic' class and highlights promising biomarkers. Few biomarkers
              achieve a high sensitivity and negative predictive value. Such
              biomarkers will require external validation in a prospective
              observational setting before adoption in clinical practice.",

  author   = "Lu, Yuping and Phillips, Charles A and Langston, Michael A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cluster analysis is a core task in modern
              data-centric computation. Algorithmic choice is driven by factors
              such as data size and heterogeneity, the similarity measures
              employed, and the type of clusters sought. Familiarity and mere
              preference often play a significant role as well. Comparisons
              between clustering algorithms tend to focus on cluster quality.
              Such comparisons are complicated by the fact that algorithms
              often have multiple settings that can affect the clusters
              produced. Such a setting may represent, for example, a preset
              variable, a parameter of interest, or various sorts of initial
              assignments. A question of interest then is this: to what degree
              do the clusters produced vary as setting values change? RESULTS:
              This work introduces a new metric, termed simply ``robustness'',
              designed to answer that question. Robustness is an
              easily-interpretable measure of the propensity of a clustering
              algorithm to maintain output coherence over a range of settings.
              The robustness of eleven popular clustering algorithms is
              evaluated over some two dozen publicly available mRNA expression
              microarray datasets. Given their straightforwardness and
              predictability, hierarchical methods generally exhibited the
              highest robustness on most datasets. Of the more complex
              strategies, the paraclique algorithm yielded consistently higher
              robustness than other algorithms tested, approaching and even
              surpassing hierarchical methods on several datasets. Other
              techniques exhibited mixed robustness, with no clear distinction
              between them. CONCLUSIONS: Robustness provides a simple and
              intuitive measure of the stability and predictability of a
              clustering algorithm. It can be a useful tool to aid both in
              algorithm selection and in deciding how much effort to devote to
              parameter tuning.",

              for exploratory microarray data analysis, as it organizes the
              data into groups of genes or samples in which the elements share
              common patterns. Once the data are clustered, finding the optimal
              number of informative subgroups within a dataset is a problem
              that, while important for understanding the underlying
              phenotypes, is one for which there is no robust, widely accepted
              solution. RESULTS: To address this problem we developed an
              'informativeness metric' based on a simple analysis of variance
              statistic that identifies the number of clusters which best
              separate phenotypic groups. The performance of the

              observed variables in biological networks by eliminating indirect
              correlations/associations, but it fails whenever there are some

              develop a multiscale association analysis to overcome this flaw.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Arsenic in drinking water is a public health issue
              affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This review
              summarizes 30 years of epidemiological studies on arsenic
              exposure in drinking water and the risk of bladder or kidney
              cancer, quantifying these risks using a meta-analytical
              framework. METHODS: Forty studies met the selection criteria.
              Seventeen provided point estimates of arsenic concentrations in
              drinking water and were used in a meta-analysis of bladder cancer
              incidence (7 studies) and mortality (10 studies) and kidney
              cancer mortality (2 studies). Risk estimates for incidence and
              mortality were analyzed separately using Generalized Linear
              Models. Predicted risks for bladder cancer incidence were
              estimated at 10, 50 and 150 $\mu$g/L arsenic in drinking water.
              Bootstrap randomizations were used to assess robustness of effect
              size. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies observed an association
              between arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer. Ten studies
              showed an association with kidney cancer, although of lower
              magnitude than that for bladder cancer. The meta-analyses showed
              the predicted risks for bladder cancer incidence were 2.7
              [1.2-4.1]; 4.2 [2.1-6.3] and; 5.8 [2.9-8.7] for drinking water
              arsenic levels of 10, 50, and 150 $\mu$g/L, respectively.
              Bootstrapped randomizations confirmed this increased risk, but,
              lowering the effect size to 1.4 [0.35-4.0], 2.3 [0.59-6.4], and
              3.1 [0.80-8.9]. The latter suggests that with exposures to 50
              $\mu$g/L, there was an 83\% probability for elevated incidence of
              bladder cancer; and a 74\% probability for elevated mortality.
              For both bladder and kidney cancers, mortality rates at 150 ug/L
              were about 30\% greater than those at 10 $\mu$g/L. CONCLUSION:
              Arsenic in drinking water is associated with an increased risk of
              bladder and kidney cancers, although at lower levels (<150
              $\mu$g/L), there is uncertainty due to the increased likelihood
              of exposure misclassification at the lower end of the exposure
              curve. Meta-analyses suggest exposure to 10 $\mu$g/L of arsenic
              in drinking water may double the risk of bladder cancer, or at
              the very least, increase it by about 40\%. With the large number
              of people exposed to these arsenic concentrations worldwide the
              public health consequences of arsenic in drinking water are
              substantial.",

              risk for developing malignancies. Polyomaviruses (PV) have been
              historically associated with experimental tumor development and
              recently described in association with renourinary malignancies
              in transplant patients. The aim of this study was to investigate
              the relationship between PV replication and smoking, and the
              development of malignant neoplasms in kidney transplant
              recipients. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was
              conducted for PV replication in all kidney biopsies and urine
              cytologies performed between 1998 and 2014 from kidney transplant
              recipients at the University of Maryland Medical Center.
              Polyomavirus-positive patients (n = 943) were defined as having
              any of the following: a kidney biopsy with PV associated
              nephropathy, any urine cytology demonstrating ``decoy'' cells,
              and/or significant polyomavirus BK viremia. Polyomavirus-negative
              matched patients (n = 943) were defined as lacking any evidence
              of PV replication. The incidence of malignancy (excluding
              nonmelanoma skin tumors) was determined in these 1886 patients
              and correlated with demographic data and history of smoking.
              RESULTS: There was a 7.9\% incidence of malignant tumors after a
              mean posttransplant follow-up of 7.9 $\pm$ 5.4 years. Among all
              cancer subtypes, only bladder carcinoma was significantly
              associated with PV replication. By multivariate analysis, only PV
              replication and smoking independently increased the risk of
              bladder cancer, relative risk, 11.7 (P = 0.0013) and 5.6 (P =
              0.0053), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the current
              study indicate that kidney transplant recipients with PV
              replication and smoking are at particular risk to develop bladder
              carcinomas and support the need for long-term cancer surveillance

              incomplete, it can be desirable to consider alternative measures
              of pairwise interconnectedness. Here we study a class of measures
              that are proportional to the number of neighbors that a pair of
              nodes share in common. For example, the topological overlap
              measure by Ravasz et al. 1 can be interpreted as a measure of
              agreement between the m = 1 step neighborhoods of 2 nodes.
              Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher
              topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same
              functional class than proteins having a lower topological
              overlap. Here we address the question whether a measure of
              topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods could
              give rise to a more robust and sensitive measure of
              interconnectedness. RESULTS: We generalize the topological
              overlap measure from m = 1 step neighborhoods to m > or = 2 step
              neighborhoods. This allows us to define the m-th order
              generalized topological overlap measure (GTOM) by (i) counting
              the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and
              (ii) normalizing it to take a value between 0 and 1. Using
              theoretical arguments, a yeast co-expression network application,
              and a fly protein network application, we illustrate the
              usefulness of the proposed measure for module detection and gene
              neighborhood analysis. CONCLUSION: Topological overlap can serve
              as an important filter to counter the effects of spurious or
              missing connections between network nodes. The m-th order
              topological overlap measure allows one to trade-off sensitivity
              versus specificity when it comes to defining pairwise
              interconnectedness and network modules.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The goal of neighborhood analysis is to find a set of
              genes (the neighborhood) that is similar to an initial 'seed' set
              of genes. Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are
              important in systems biology. If individual network connections
              are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define
              neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness
              measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of
              multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative
              neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node
              similarity measures. RESULTS: The pairwise topological overlap
              measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently
              used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local
              permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size.
              Using four network applications and a simulated example, we
              provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are
              biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to
              identify brain cancer related genes. AVAILABILITY: An executable

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for
              understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic
              phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide
              ``reverse engineering'' of such networks have been successful
              only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present
              ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles,
              specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory
              networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a
              wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses
              an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of
              indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS:
              We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly
              (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology
              is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in
              practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex
              topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct
              transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic
              synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On
              synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and
              outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and
              Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic
              networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer
              validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We
              also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on
              network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual
              information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors.
              CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct
              transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a
              problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering
              algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use
              microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Signaling networks in eukaryotes are made up of
              upstream and downstream subnetworks. The upstream subnetwork
              contains the intertwined network of signaling pathways, while the
              downstream regulatory part contains transcription factors and
              their binding sites on the DNA as well as microRNAs and their
              mRNA targets. Currently, most signaling and regulatory databases
              contain only a subsection of this network, making comprehensive
              analyses highly time-consuming and dependent on specific data
              handling expertise. The need for detailed mapping of signaling
              systems is also supported by the fact that several drug
              development failures were caused by undiscovered cross-talk or
              regulatory effects of drug targets. We previously created a
              uniformly curated signaling pathway resource, SignaLink, to
              facilitate the analysis of pathway cross-talks. Here, we present
              SignaLink 2, which significantly extends the coverage and
              applications of its predecessor. DESCRIPTION: We developed a
              novel concept to integrate and utilize different subsections
              (i.e., layers) of the signaling network. The multi-layered
              (onion-like) database structure is made up of signaling pathways,
              their pathway regulators (e.g., scaffold and endocytotic
              proteins) and modifier enzymes (e.g., phosphatases, ubiquitin
              ligases), as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional
              regulators of all of these components. The user-friendly website
              allows the interactive exploration of how each signaling protein
              is regulated. The customizable download page enables the analysis
              of any user-specified part of the signaling network. Compared to
              other signaling resources, distinctive features of SignaLink 2
              are the following: 1) it involves experimental data not only from
              humans but from two invertebrate model organisms, C. elegans and
              D. melanogaster; 2) combines manual curation with large-scale
              datasets; 3) provides confidence scores for each interaction; 4)
              operates a customizable download page with multiple file formats
              (e.g., BioPAX, Cytoscape, SBML). Non-profit users can access
              SignaLink 2 free of charge at http://SignaLink.org. CONCLUSIONS:
              With SignaLink 2 as a single resource, users can effectively
              analyze signaling pathways, scaffold proteins, modifier enzymes,
              transcription factors and miRNAs that are important in the
              regulation of signaling processes. This integrated resource
              allows the systems-level examination of how cross-talks and
              signaling flow are regulated, as well as provide data for
              cross-species comparisons and drug discovery analyses.",

              reconstruct a more complete picture of the molecular events
              associated with human diseases, but pose challenges in data
              analysis. Network-based methods for the analysis of multi-omics
              leverage the complex web of macromolecular interactions occurring
              within cells to extract significant patterns of molecular
              alterations. Existing network-based approaches typically address
              specific combinations of omics and are limited in terms of the
              number of layers that can be jointly analysed. In this study, we
              investigate the application of network diffusion to quantify gene
              relevance on the basis of multiple evidences (layers). RESULTS:
              We introduce a gene score (mND) that quantifies the relevance of
              a gene in a biological process taking into account the network
              proximity of the gene and its first neighbours to other altered
              genes. We show that mND has a better performance over existing
              methods in finding altered genes in network proximity in one or
              more layers. We also report good performances in recovering known
              cancer genes. The pipeline described in this article is broadly
              applicable, because it can handle different types of inputs: in
              addition to multi-omics datasets, datasets that are stratified in

              The SIGnaling Network Open Resource, SIGNOR (available on line at
              http://signor.uniroma2.it), was developed to support such a
              strategy by providing a scaffold of prior experimental evidence
              of causal relationships between biological entities. The core of
              SIGNOR is a collection of approximately 12,000 manually-annotated
              causal relationships between over 2800 human proteins
              participating in signal transduction. Other entities annotated in
              SIGNOR are complexes, chemicals, phenotypes and stimuli. The
              information captured in SIGNOR can be represented as a signed
              directed graph illustrating the activation/inactivation
              relationships between signalling entities. Each entry is
              associated to the post-translational modifications that cause the
              activation/inactivation of the target proteins. More than 4900
              modified residues causing a change in protein concentration or
              activity have been curated and linked to the modifying enzymes
              (about 351 human kinases and 94 phosphatases). Additional
              modifications such as ubiquitinations, sumoylations, acetylations
              and their effect on the modified target proteins are also

              useful information from massive data sets for further analysis. A
              pathway-based analysis may shed light by projecting candidate
              genes onto protein functional relationship networks. We are
              building such a pathway-based analysis system. RESULTS: We have
              constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending
              curated pathways with non-curated sources of information,
              including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression,
              protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and
              text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50\% of the
              human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma
              multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes
              onto the network, we found that the majority of GBM candidate
              genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and
              the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two
              network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are
              localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another
              comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly
              enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved
              in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found
              in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We
              have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon
              expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis
              of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets. The

              and manual processes and quality control steps. First, fully

              sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of organisms

              bladder cancer in the USA during 2010 was $US4 billion and is
              expected to rise to $US5 billion by 2020. Ten years ago, urinary
              markers held the potential to lower treatment costs of bladder
              cancer. However, subsequent real-world experiments have
              demonstrated that further work is necessary to identify
              situations in which these technologies can be applied in a
              cost-effective manner. Adjunct cytology remains a part of
              diagnostic standard of care, but recent research suggests that it
              is not cost effective due to its low diagnostic yield. Analysis
              of intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral resection of
              bladder tumor (TURBT), neo-adjuvant therapy for cystectomy, and
              robot-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy suggests that these
              technologies are cost effective and should be implemented more
              widely for appropriate patients. The existing literature on the
              cost effectiveness of bladder cancer treatments has improved
              substantially since 2000. The body of work now includes many new
              models, registry analyses, and real-world studies. However, there
              is still a need for new implementation guidelines, new risk
              modeling tools, and a better understanding of the empirical
              burden of bladder cancer.",

              approach for network reconstruction, e.g. in the context of gene
              regulation, relies on the precision matrix (the inverse of the
              covariance matrix) as an indicator of which variables are
              directly associated. The precision matrix assumes Gaussian linear
              data and its entries are zero for pairs of variables that are
              independent given all other variables. However, there is still
              very little theory on network reconstruction under the assumption
              of non-linear interactions among variables. RESULTS: We propose
              Distance Precision Matrix, a network reconstruction method aimed
              at both linear and non-linear data. Like partial distance
              correlation, it builds on distance covariance, a measure of
              possibly non-linear association, and on the idea of full-order
              partial correlation, which allows to discard indirect
              associations. We provide evidence that the Distance Precision
              Matrix method can successfully compute networks from linear and
              non-linear data, and consistently so across different datasets,
              even if sample size is low. The method is fast enough to compute

              Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1

              million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin

              cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated
              2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%),
              colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%)
              cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death,
              with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by
              colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female
              breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to
              3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for
              both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little
              for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers,
              however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus
              transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2
              per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected
              to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a
              larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus
              transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes,

  abstract = "Many complex networks exhibit a modular structure of densely
              connected groups of nodes. Usually, such a modular structure is
              uncovered by the optimization of some quality function. Although
              flawed, modularity remains one of the most popular quality
              functions. The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for
              optimizing modularity, but has been applied to a variety of
              methods. As such, speeding up the Louvain algorithm enables the
              analysis of larger graphs in a shorter time for various methods.
              We here suggest to consider moving nodes to a random neighbor
              community, instead of the best neighbor community. Although
              incredibly simple, it reduces the theoretical runtime complexity
              from O(m) to O(nlog〈k〉) in networks with a clear community
              structure. In benchmark networks, it speeds up the algorithm
              roughly 2-3 times, while in some real networks it even reaches 10
              times faster runtimes. This improvement is due to two factors:
              (1) a random neighbor is likely to be in a ``good'' community and
              (2) random neighbors are likely to be hubs, helping the
              convergence. Finally, the performance gain only slightly
              diminishes the quality, especially for modularity, thus providing
              a good quality-performance ratio. However, these gains are less
              pronounced, or even disappear, for some other measures such as

  abstract  = "Community detection is an increasingly popular approach to
               uncover important structures in large networks. Flow-based
               community detection methods rely on communication patterns of
               the network rather than structural properties to determine
               communities. The Infomap algorithm in particular optimizes a
               novel objective function called the map equation and has been
               shown to outperform other approaches in third-party benchmarks.
               However, Infomap and its variants are inherently sequential,
               limiting their use for large-scale graphs.In this article, we
               propose a novel algorithm to optimize the map equation called
               RelaxMap. RelaxMap provides two important improvements over
               Infomap: parallelization, so that the map equation can be
               optimized over much larger graphs, and prioritization, so that
               the most important work occurs first, iterations take less time,
               and the algorithm converges faster. We implement these
               techniques using OpenMP on shared-memory multicore systems, and
               evaluate our approach on a variety of graphs from standard graph
               clustering benchmarks as well as real graph datasets. Our
               evaluation shows that both techniques are effective: RelaxMap
               achieves 70\% parallel efficiency on eight cores, and
               prioritization improves algorithm performance by an additional
               20--50\% on average, depending on the graph properties.
               Additionally, RelaxMap converges in the similar number of
               iterations and provides solutions of equivalent quality as the
               serial Infomap implementation.",

              a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known
              local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms.
              Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses
              the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on
              an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart

              higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale
              modularity optimization, among which the popular ``Louvain

  title     = "Graph Clustering Via a Discrete Uncoupling Process",
  author    = "Van Dongen, Stijn",
  abstract  = "A discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced,
               called the Markov Cluster Process or the MCL process. The
               process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called
               the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as
               input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step
               defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one.
               Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic
               matrix, where $k\in\N$. Inflation corresponds with a
               parametrized operator $\Gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set
               of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image $\Gamma_r
               M$ is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and
               rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the
               process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant
               under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic
               convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the
               process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing
               cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the
               matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected
               components of (the graph associated with) the process limit
               generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is
               in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a
               weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and
               highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL
               process are established. Most notably, the process (and
               algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing
               the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inflation
               operator $\Gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are
               diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase
               diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices
               that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix.
               For $r\in\N$ and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image
               $\Gamma_r M$ is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisfied
               by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal
               elements of M, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto
               clusterings. The spectrum of $\Gamma_\{\infty\} M$ is of the
               form $\{0^\{n-k\}, 1^k\}$, where k is the number of endclasses
               of the ordering associated with M, and n is the dimension of M.
               This attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.",

              links between structure and function in complex networks and for
              practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and
              sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the
              optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality
              index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that
              modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than
              a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the
              degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where

              integrate information from input data across connected nodes in a
              given network. These algorithms have wide applications in systems
              biology, protein function prediction, inferring
              condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing
              disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation,
              there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms
              on real data and little guidance on how to select and
              parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this
              problem by analyzing different combinations of network
              normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating
              schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on

              risk of a 'topology bias' caused by the incorrect use of network
              normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network
              propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing
              the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal
              parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated
              that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either
              maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g.
              proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency
              between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the

  abstract = "A fundamental challenge in human health is the identification of
              disease-causing genes. Recently, several studies have tackled
              this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the
              observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend
              to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or
              functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use
              only local network information in the inference process and are
              restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we
              provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease
              genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call
              PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the
              prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the
              network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function
              to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations
              with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease
              association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and
              the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method
              outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369
              diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a
              cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for
              34\% of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes
              that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and
              conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our
              method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some
              causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer
              and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these
              diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several

              The analysis of such genetic variants has led to successful
              identification of altered proteins underlying many Mendelian
              disorders. Nevertheless the simple one-variant one-phenotype
              model valid for many monogenic diseases does not capture the
              complexity of polygenic traits and disorders. Although
              experimental and computational approaches have improved detection
              of functionally deleterious variants and important interactions
              between gene products, the development of comprehensive models
              relating genotype and phenotypes remains a challenge in the field
              of genomic medicine. In this context, a new view of the
              pathologic state as significant perturbation of the network of
              interactions between biomolecules is crucial for the
              identification of biochemical pathways associated with complex
              phenotypes. Seminal studies in systems biology combined the
              analysis of genetic variation with protein-protein interaction
              networks to demonstrate that even as biological systems evolve to
              be robust to genetic variation, their topologies create disease
              vulnerabilities. More recent analyses model the impact of genetic
              variants as changes to the ``wiring'' of the interactome to
              better capture heterogeneity in genotype-phenotype relationships.
              These studies lay the foundation for using networks to predict
              variant effects at scale using machine-learning or algorithmic
              approaches. A wealth of databases and resources for the

              nonadditive genetic interactions, which underlie the synergistic
              combinations of mutations often linked to complex diseases. Here,
              we analyze a large-scale, human gene functional interaction

              can be effectively identified by GBA in cross-validated tests
              using label propagation algorithms related to Google's PageRank.
              However, GBA has been shown to work poorly in genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS), where many genes are somewhat
              implicated, but few are known with very high certainty. Here, we
              resolve this by explicitly modeling the uncertainty of the
              associations and incorporating the uncertainty for the seed set

              measure the fraction of subjects living for a certain amount of
              time after treatment. In clinical trials or community trials, the
              effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of
              subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period
              of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence
              of a given event, for example death is called as survival time
              and the analysis of group data as survival analysis. This can be
              affected by subjects under study that are uncooperative and
              refused to be remained in the study or when some of the subjects
              may not experience the event or death before the end of the

              of methodological factors that can bias results. We hypothesized
              that high classification results in ADHD diagnosis are inflated
              by methodological factors. METHODS: We reviewed 69 studies (of 95
              studies identified) that used neuroimaging features to predict
              ADHD diagnosis. Based on reported methods, we assessed the
              prevalence of circular analysis, which inflates classification
              accuracy, and evaluated the relationship between sample size and
              accuracy to test if small-sample models tend to report higher
              classification accuracy, also an indicator of bias. RESULTS:
              Circular analysis was detected in 15.9\% of ADHD classification
              studies, lack of independent test set was noted in 13\%, and
              insufficient methodological detail to establish its presence was
              noted in another 11.6\%. Accuracy of classification ranged from
              60\% to 80\% in the 59.4\% of reviewed studies that met criteria
              for independence of feature selection, model construction, and
              test datasets. Moreover, there was a negative relationship
              between accuracy and sample size, implying additional bias
              contributing to reported accuracies at lower sample sizes.
              CONCLUSIONS: High classification accuracies in neuroimaging
              studies of ADHD appear to be inflated by circular analysis and
              small sample size. Accuracies on independent datasets were
              consistent with known heterogeneity of the disorder. Steps to
              resolve these issues, and a shift toward accounting for sample

              characterized with different behaviors in clinical and molecular
              profiles, such as survival rates, gene signature and copy number
              aberrations (CNAs). While cancer is generally believed to have
              been caused by genetic aberrations, the number of such events is
              tremendous in the cancer tissue and only a small subset of them
              may be tumorigenic. On the other hand, gene expression signature
              of a subtype represents residuals of the subtype-specific cancer
              mechanisms. Using high-throughput data to link these factors to
              define subtype boundaries and identify subtype-specific drivers,
              is a promising yet largely unexplored topic. RESULTS: We report a
              systematic method to automate the identification of cancer
              subtypes and candidate drivers. Specifically, we propose an
              iterative algorithm that alternates between gene expression
              clustering and gene signature selection. We applied the method to
              datasets of the pediatric cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma (MB).
              The subtyping algorithm consistently converges on multiple
              datasets of medulloblastoma, and the converged signatures and
              copy number landscapes are also found to be highly reproducible
              across the datasets. Based on the identified subtypes, we
              developed a PCA-based approach for subtype-specific
              identification of cancer drivers. The top-ranked driver
              candidates are found to be enriched with known pathways in
              certain subtypes of MB. This might reveal new understandings for
              these subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that
              subtype-signature defines the subtype boundaries, characterizes
              the subtype-specific processes and can be used to prioritize
              signature-related drivers.",

              clinical oncology, development of RNA-based diagnostics has been
              more limited. An exception to this trend is the growing use of
              mRNA-based methods in early-stage breast cancer. Although DNA and
              mRNA are used together in breast cancer research, the distinct
              contribution of mRNA beyond that of DNA in clinical challenges
              has not yet been directly assessed. We hypothesize that mRNA
              harbors prognostically useful information independently of
              genomic variation. To validate this, we use both genomic
              mutations and gene expression to predict five-year breast cancer
              recurrence in an integrated test model. This is accomplished
              first by comparing the feature importance of DNA and mRNA
              features in a model trained on both, and second, by evaluating
              the difference in performance of models trained on DNA and mRNA
              data separately. RESULTS: We find that models trained on DNA and
              mRNA data give more weight to mRNA features than to DNA features,

              serve as a framework for the interpretation of the relative

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: One approach to improving the personalized treatment
              of cancer is to understand the cellular signaling transduction
              pathways that cause cancer at the level of the individual
              patient. In this study, we used unsupervised deep learning to
              learn the hierarchical structure within cancer gene expression
              data. Deep learning is a group of machine learning algorithms
              that use multiple layers of hidden units to capture
              hierarchically related, alternative representations of the input
              data. We hypothesize that this hierarchical structure learned by
              deep learning will be related to the cellular signaling system.
              RESULTS: Robust deep learning model selection identified a
              network architecture that is biologically plausible. Our model
              selection results indicated that the 1st hidden layer of our deep
              learning model should contain about 1300 hidden units to most
              effectively capture the covariance structure of the input data.
              This agrees with the estimated number of human transcription
              factors, which is approximately 1400. This result lends support
              to our hypothesis that the 1st hidden layer of a deep learning
              model trained on gene expression data may represent signals
              related to transcription factor activation. Using the 3rd hidden
              layer representation of each tumor as learned by our unsupervised
              deep learning model, we performed consensus clustering on all
              tumor samples-leading to the discovery of clusters of
              glioblastoma multiforme with differential survival. One of these
              clusters contained all of the glioblastoma samples with G-CIMP, a
              known methylation phenotype driven by the IDH1 mutation and
              associated with favorable prognosis, suggesting that the hidden
              units in the 3rd hidden layer representations captured a
              methylation signal without explicitly using methylation data as
              input. We also found differentially expressed genes and
              well-known mutations (NF1, IDH1, EGFR) that were uniquely
              correlated with each of these clusters. Exploring these unique
              genes and mutations will allow us to further investigate the
              disease mechanisms underlying each of these clusters.
              CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that a deep learning model can
              be trained to represent biologically and clinically meaningful
              abstractions of cancer gene expression data. Understanding what
              additional relationships these hidden layer abstractions have
              with the cancer cellular signaling system could have a
              significant impact on the understanding and treatment of cancer.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The wingless-Int (WNT) pathway has an essential role
              in cell regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). For Acute
              Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the malignant counterpart of HSC,
              currently only a selective number of genes of the WNT pathway are
              analyzed by using either gene expression or DNA-methylation
              profiles for the identification of prognostic markers and
              potential candidate targets for drug therapy. It is known that
              mRNA expression is controlled by DNA-methylation and that
              specific patterns can infer the ability to differentiate
              biological differences, thus a combined analysis using all WNT
              annotated genes could provide more insight in the WNT signaling.
              APPROACH: We created a computational approach that integrates
              gene expression and DNA promoter methylation profiles. The
              approach represents the continuous gene expression and promoter
              methylation profiles with nine discrete mutually exclusive
              scenarios. The scenario representation allows for a refinement of
              patient groups by a more powerful statistical analysis, and the
              construction of a co-expression network. We focused on 268 WNT
              annotated signaling genes that are derived from the molecular
              signature database. RESULTS: Using the scenarios we identified
              seven prognostic markers for overall survival and event-free
              survival. Three genes are novel prognostic markers; two with
              favorable outcome (PSMD2, PPARD) and one with unfavorable outcome
              (XPNPEP). The remaining four genes (LEF1, SFRP2, RUNX1, and
              AXIN2) were previously identified but we could refine the patient
              groups. Three AML risk groups were further analyzed and the
              co-expression network showed that only the good risk group
              harbors frequent promoter hypermethylation and significantly
              correlated interactions with proteasome family members.
              CONCLUSION: Our results provide novel insights in WNT signaling
              in AML, we discovered new and previously identified prognostic
              markers and a refinement of the patient groups.",

              biological mechanisms underlying these patterns. To this end, we
              systematically studied the association between somatic mutations
              in protein-coding regions and expression profiles, which
              represents an indirect measurement of impacts. We defined
              mutation features (mutation type, cluster and status) and built
              linear regression models to assess mutation associations with
              mRNA expression and protein expression. Our results presented a
              comprehensive landscape of the associations between mutation
              features and expression profile in multiple cancer types,
              including 62 genes showing mutation type associated expression
              changes, 21 genes showing mutation cluster associations and 51
              genes showing mutation status associations. We revealed four
              characteristics of the patterns that mutations impact on
              expression. First, we showed that mutation type (truncation

              clusters in well-studied oncogenes that were associated with gene
              expression. Third, we found both similarities and differences in
              association patterns existed within and across cancer types.
              Fourth, although many of the observed associations stay stable at
              both mRNA and protein expression levels, there are also novel
              associations uniquely observed at the protein level, which
              warrant future investigation. Taken together, our findings

              for understanding tumor heterogeneity. Existing methods to
              identify cancer subtypes have primarily focused on utilizing
              generic clustering algorithms (such as hierarchical clustering)
              to identify subtypes based on gene expression data. The
              network-level interaction among genes, which is key to
              understanding the molecular perturbations in cancer, has been
              rarely considered during the clustering process. The motivation
              of our work is to develop a method that effectively incorporates
              molecular interaction networks into the clustering process to
              improve cancer subtype identification. RESULTS: We have developed
              a new clustering algorithm for cancer subtype identification,
              called ``network-assisted co-clustering for the identification of
              cancer subtypes'' (NCIS). NCIS combines gene network information
              to simultaneously group samples and genes into biologically
              meaningful clusters. Prior to clustering, we assign weights to
              genes based on their impact in the network. Then a new weighted
              co-clustering algorithm based on a semi-nonnegative matrix
              tri-factorization is applied. We evaluated the effectiveness of
              NCIS on simulated datasets as well as large-scale Breast Cancer

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identifying cancer subtypes is an important component
              of the personalised medicine framework. An increasing number of
              computational methods have been developed to identify cancer
              subtypes. However, existing methods rarely use information from
              gene regulatory networks to facilitate the subtype
              identification. It is widely accepted that gene regulatory
              networks play crucial roles in understanding the mechanisms of
              diseases. Different cancer subtypes are likely caused by
              different regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, there are great
              opportunities for developing methods that can utilise network
              information in identifying cancer subtypes. RESULTS: In this
              paper, we propose a method, weighted similarity network fusion
              (WSNF), to utilise the information in the complex miRNA-TF-mRNA
              regulatory network in identifying cancer subtypes. We firstly
              build the regulatory network where the nodes represent the
              features, i.e. the microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors
              (TFs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and the edges indicate the
              interactions between the features. The interactions are retrieved
              from various interatomic databases. We then use the network
              information and the expression data of the miRNAs, TFs and mRNAs
              to calculate the weight of the features, representing the level
              of importance of the features. The feature weight is then
              integrated into a network fusion approach to cluster the samples
              (patients) and thus to identify cancer subtypes. We applied our
              method to the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and
              glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) datasets. The experimental results
              show that WSNF performs better than the other commonly used
              computational methods, and the information from miRNA-TF-mRNA
              regulatory network contributes to the performance improvement.
              The WSNF method successfully identified five breast cancer

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: IntClust is a classification of breast cancer
              comprising 10 subtypes based on molecular drivers identified
              through the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data from
              1,000 breast tumors and validated in a further 1,000. We present
              a reliable method for subtyping breast tumors into the IntClust
              subtypes based on gene expression and demonstrate the clinical
              and biological validity of the IntClust classification. RESULTS:
              We developed a gene expression-based approach for classifying
              breast tumors into the ten IntClust subtypes by using the
              ensemble profile of the index discovery dataset. We evaluate this
              approach in 983 independent samples for which the combined
              copy-number and gene expression IntClust classification was
              available. Only 24 samples are discordantly classified. Next, we
              compile a consolidated external dataset composed of a further
              7,544 breast tumors. We use our approach to classify all samples
              into the IntClust subtypes. All ten subtypes are observable in
              most studies at comparable frequencies. The IntClust subtypes are
              significantly associated with relapse-free survival and
              recapitulate patterns of survival observed previously. In studies
              of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, IntClust reveals distinct patterns
              of chemosensitivity. Finally, patterns of expression of genomic
              drivers reported by TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) are better
              explained by IntClust as compared to the PAM50 classifier.
              CONCLUSIONS: IntClust subtypes are reproducible in a large
              meta-analysis, show clinical validity and best capture variation
              in genomic drivers. IntClust is a driver-based breast cancer
              classification and is likely to become increasingly relevant as
              more targeted biological therapies become available.",

  abstract = "Different data types can offer complementary perspectives on the
              same biological phenomenon. In cancer studies, for example, data
              on copy number alterations indicate losses and amplifications of
              genomic regions in tumours, while transcriptomic data point to
              the impact of genomic and environmental events on the internal
              wiring of the cell. Fusing different data provides a more
              comprehensive model of the cancer cell than that offered by any
              single type. However, biological signals in different patients
              exhibit diverse degrees of concordance due to cancer
              heterogeneity and inherent noise in the measurements. This is a
              particularly important issue in cancer subtype discovery, where
              personalised strategies to guide therapy are of vital importance.
              We present a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering
              prognostic cancer subtypes by integrating gene expression and
              copy number variation data. Our model is constructed from a
              hierarchy of Dirichlet Processes and addresses three key
              challenges in data fusion: (i) To separate concordant from
              discordant signals, (ii) to select informative features, (iii) to
              estimate the number of disease subtypes. Concordance of signals
              is assessed individually for each patient, giving us an
              additional level of insight into the underlying disease
              structure. We exemplify the power of our model in prostate cancer
              and breast cancer and show that it outperforms competing methods.
              In the prostate cancer data, we identify an entirely new subtype
              with extremely poor survival outcome and show how other analyses
              fail to detect it. In the breast cancer data, we find subtypes
              with superior prognostic value by using the concordant results.
              These discoveries were crucially dependent on our model's ability
              to distinguish concordant and discordant signals within each
              patient sample, and would otherwise have been missed. We
              therefore demonstrate the importance of taking a patient-specific
              approach, using highly-flexible nonparametric Bayesian methods.",

              brain sciences reflects a metaphor. However, there is no single
              definition of the word ``computer'' in use. In fact, based on the
              usage of the word ``computer'' in computer science, a computer is
              merely some physical machinery that can in theory compute any
              computable function. According to this definition the brain is
              literally a computer; there is no metaphor. But, this deviates
              from how the word ``computer'' is used in other academic
              disciplines. According to the definition used outside of computer
              science, ``computers'' are human-made devices that engage in
              sequential processing of inputs to produce outputs. According to
              this definition, brains are not computers, and arguably,
              computers serve as a weak metaphor for brains. Thus, we argue
              that the recurring brain-computer metaphor debate is actually
              just a semantic disagreement, because brains are either literally
              computers or clearly not very much like computers at all,
              depending on one's definitions. We propose that the best path
              forward is simply to put the debate to rest, and instead, have
              researchers be clear about which definition they are using in
              their work. In some circumstances, one can use the definition
              from computer science and simply ask, what type of computer is
              the brain? In other circumstances, it is important to use the

               provide insight into the underlying biology but is challenged by
               modeling complex interactions. Objective: We introduce OBaNK:
               omics integration using Bayesian networks and external
               knowledge, an algorithm to model interactions between
               heterogeneous high-dimensional biological data to elucidate
               complex functional clusters and emergent relationships
               associated with an observed phenotype. Method: Using Bayesian
               network learning, we modeled the statistical dependencies and
               interactions between lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
               data. The strength of a learned interaction between molecules
               was altered based on external knowledge. Results : Networks
               learned from synthetic datasets based on real pathways achieved
               an average area under the curve score of ~0.85, an improvement
               of ~0.23 from baseline methods. When applied to real multi-omics
               data collected during pregnancy, five distinct functional
               networks of heterogeneous biological data were identified, and
               the results were compared to other multi-omics integration
               approaches. Conclusion: OBaNK successfully improved the accuracy
               of learning interaction networks from data integrating external
               knowledge, identified heterogeneous functional networks from
               real data, and suggested potential novel interactions associated

              Many integration methods for cancer subtyping have been proposed,

              to the lack of gold standards. Moreover, questions of practical

              selecting appropriate data types and combinations on the
              performance of integrative studies. Here, we constructed three
              classes of benchmarking datasets of nine cancers in TCGA by
              considering all the eleven combinations of four multi-omics data

               Recently, the abundant multi-omics data have provided
               unprecedented opportunities to discover intrinsic subtypes at an

              discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a
              comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012)
              486(7403):346-352] has recently shown that integrative clustering
              of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals
              novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show
              distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative
              analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively
              parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of
              discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated
              genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea
              is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes
              can be predicted by a set of orthogonal latent variables that
              represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor
              subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer

              cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential
              cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates
              the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent,

              alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal

              of dopaminergic neurons at the substantia nigra pars compacta,
              which affects the normal dynamics of the basal
              ganglia-thalamus-cortex (BG-T-C) neuronal circuit of the brain.
              Although there are multiple mechanisms underlying the disease, a

              pathogenesis are still missing, and there is still no cure. To
              address this gap, computational models that resemble

              algorithm, termed moCluster, which discovers joint patterns among
              multiple omics data. The method first employs a multiblock
              multivariate analysis to define a set of latent variables
              representing joint patterns across input data sets, which is
              further passed to an ordinary clustering algorithm in order to
              discover joint clusters. Using simulated data, we show that
              moCluster's performance is not compromised by issues present in
              iCluster/iCluster+ (notably, the nondeterministic solution) and
              that it operates 100$\times$ to 1000$\times$ faster than

              various methods developed for reconstruction of GRNs from gene
              expression profiles, they are notorious for high false positive
              rate owing to the noise inherited in the data, especially for the
              dataset with a large number of genes but a small number of
              samples. RESULTS: In this work, we present a novel method, namely
              NARROMI, to improve the accuracy of GRN inference by combining
              ordinary differential equation-based recursive optimization (RO)
              and information theory-based mutual information (MI). In the
              proposed algorithm, the noisy regulations with low pairwise
              correlations are first removed by using MI, and the redundant
              regulations from indirect regulators are further excluded by RO
              to improve the accuracy of inferred GRNs. In particular, the RO
              step can help to determine regulatory directions without prior

              modeling of the associations between different data types and the

              no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment
              of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we
              report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomas
              to provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations.
              There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32
              genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle
              regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways,
              as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly
              mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression
              subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like)
              were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data.
              Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame
              activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of
              several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene
              inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic
              targets in 69\% of the tumours, including 42\% with targets in
              the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45\%
              with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin
              regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial
              carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far,

              for precision medicine. Large-scale genomic profiling studies
              such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have
              generated vast amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic,
              and proteomic data. While these studies have provided great
              resources for researchers to discover clinically relevant tumor
              subtypes and driver molecular alterations, there are few

              clustering analysis of these multi-type omics data. Therefore,
              the aim of this article is to develop a fully Bayesian latent

              omics data of continuous and discrete data types for
              identification of tumor subtypes and relevant omics features.
              Specifically, the proposed method uses a few latent variables to
              capture the inherent structure of multiple omics data sets to
              achieve joint dimension reduction. As a result, the tumor samples
              can be clustered in the latent variable space and relevant omics
              features that drive the sample clustering are identified through
              Bayesian variable selection. This method significantly improve on
              the existing integrative clustering method iClusterPlus in terms
              of statistical inference and computational speed. By analyzing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are
              phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Gene-expression
              profiling has identified subgroups of DLBCL (activated
              B-cell-like [ABC], germinal-center B-cell-like [GCB], and
              unclassified) according to cell of origin that are associated
              with a differential response to chemotherapy and targeted agents.
              We sought to extend these findings by identifying genetic
              subtypes of DLBCL based on shared genomic abnormalities and to
              uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities based on tumor genetics.
              METHODS: We studied 574 DLBCL biopsy samples using exome and
              transcriptome sequencing, array-based DNA copy-number analysis,
              and targeted amplicon resequencing of 372 genes to identify genes
              with recurrent aberrations. We developed and implemented an
              algorithm to discover genetic subtypes based on the co-occurrence
              of genetic alterations. RESULTS: We identified four prominent
              genetic subtypes in DLBCL, termed MCD (based on the co-occurrence
              of MYD88L265P and CD79B mutations), BN2 (based on BCL6 fusions
              and NOTCH2 mutations), N1 (based on NOTCH1 mutations), and EZB
              (based on EZH2 mutations and BCL2 translocations). Genetic
              aberrations in multiple genes distinguished each genetic subtype
              from other DLBCLs. These subtypes differed phenotypically, as
              judged by differences in gene-expression signatures and responses
              to immunochemotherapy, with favorable survival in the BN2 and EZB
              subtypes and inferior outcomes in the MCD and N1 subtypes.
              Analysis of genetic pathways suggested that MCD and BN2 DLBCLs
              rely on ``chronic active'' B-cell receptor signaling that is
              amenable to therapeutic inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered
              genetic subtypes of DLBCL with distinct genotypic, epigenetic,
              and clinical characteristics, providing a potential nosology for
              precision-medicine strategies in DLBCL. (Funded by the Intramural

              study this problem of how to calculate the similarity between two
              samples by considering feature interaction network, where a
              feature interaction network represents the relationship between
              features. This is different from some traditional methods, those
              of which learn similarities based on a sample network that
              represents the relationship between samples. Therefore, we
              propose a novel network-based similarity metric for computing the
              similarity between samples, which incorporates the knowledge of
              feature interaction network, in order to overcome the data
              sparseness problem. Our similarity metric uses a new Feature
              Alignment Similarity measure, which does not directly compute the
              similarities among samples, but projects each sample into a
              feature interaction network and measures the similarities between
              two samples using the similarities between the vertices of the
              samples in the network. As such, when two samples do not share
              any common features, they are likely to have higher similarity
              values when their features share the similar network regions. For
              ensuring that the metric is useful in a real-world application,
              we apply our metric to discover subtypes in tumor mutational data
              by incorporating the information of the gene interaction network.
              Our experimental results from using synthetic data and real-world
              tumor mutational data show that our approach outperforms the top

              known and/or inferred relations between genes. In the last

              referred to as network propagation-has been exploited in several
              network-based pipelines, thanks to its ability of amplifying
              association between genes that lie in network proximity. Indeed,
              network diffusion provides a quantitative estimation of network

              under the shared stewardship of multiple specialist communities.
              Its complexity stems from the fact that it is simultaneously a

              genetics, and a functional molecule. In short, the human genome

              High-throughput technologies provide multiple omics data for
              cancer subtyping. Integration of multi-view data is used to
              identify cancer subtypes in many computational methods, which
              obtain different subtypes for the same cancer, even using the
              same multi-omics data. To a certain extent, these subtypes from
              distinct methods are related, which may have certain guiding

              effectively utilize the valuable information of distinct subtypes

              the mechanisms of active sampling remain poorly understood. We
              review a nascent neuroscientific literature that examines
              active-sampling policies and their relation to attention and
              curiosity. We distinguish between information sampling, in which
              organisms reduce uncertainty relevant to a familiar task, and
              information search, in which they investigate in an open-ended
              fashion to discover new tasks. We review evidence that both
              sampling and search depend on individual preferences over
              cognitive states, including attitudes towards uncertainty,
              learning progress and types of information. We propose that,
              although these preferences are non-instrumental and can on
              occasion interfere with external goals, they are important
              heuristics that allow organisms to cope with the high complexity
              of both sampling and search, and generate curiosity-driven
              investigations in large, open environments in which rewards are
              sparse and ex ante unknown.",

              the 3' or 5' ends of transcripts, providing accurate gene
              expression but little information on the RNA isoforms expressed
              in each cell. Newly developed long-read (LR) scRNA-seq enables
              the quantification of RNA isoforms in individual cells but LR
              scRNA-seq using the Oxford Nanopore platform has largely relied

              gene regulatory networks or gene circuits have documented in a
              large number of knowledge-based repositories. They provide
              systematic information and guidance of the functional connections
              between regulators, e.g. transcription factor proteins and
              miRNAs, and target genes. Network activity is defined as the
              degree of consistency between a regulatory network architecture
              and a specific cellular context of gene expression and can also
              be measured as a score of statistical significance. The gene
              network activities are closely related to the dynamics of cell
              states. To evaluate the activity of regulatory events in the form
              of network, we propose a network activity evaluation (NAE)
              framework by measuring the consistency between network
              architecture and gene expression data across specific states
              based on mathematical programming. NAE firstly employs the
              dynamic Bayesian network model to formulate the network structure
              with time series profiling data. For the constraints of prior
              knowledge about gene regulatory network, NAE introduces an
              interpretable general loss function with regularization penalties
              to calculate the degree of consistency between gene network and
              gene expression data. Moreover, we design a fast and convergent
              alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to
              optimize the regularized constraint programming. The efficiency
              and advantage of the NAE framework is deduced through numerous
              experiments and comparison studies. It reflects the possibility
              and potential of the match between network and data, thereby
              helping to reveal the network activity and to explain the dynamic
              responds underlying the network structure caused by changes in

              systems, such as brain-related diseases and behavioral traits.
              Despite the recent improvement in the prediction of phenotypes
              from genotypes, they can be further improved and explainability
              of these predictions remains challenging, primarily due to
              complex underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Emerging
              multimodal data enables studying such mechanisms at different
              scales from genotype to phenotypes involving intermediate
              phenotypes like gene expression. However, due to the black-box
              nature of many machine learning techniques, it is challenging to
              integrate these multi-modalities and interpret the biological
              insights in prediction, especially when some modality is missing.
              Biological knowledge has recently been incorporated into machine
              learning modeling to help understand the reasoning behind the
              choices made by these models. To this end, we developed DeepGAMI,
              an interpretable deep learning model to improve
              genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI uses
              prior biological knowledge to define the neural network
              architecture. Notably, it embeds an auxiliary-learning layer for
              cross-modal imputation while training the model from multimodal
              data. Using this pre-trained layer, we can impute latent features
              of additional modalities and thus enable predicting phenotypes
              from a single modality only. Finally, the model uses integrated
              gradient to prioritize multimodal features and links for
              phenotypes. We applied DeepGAMI to multiple emerging multimodal
              datasets: (1) population-level genotype and bulk-tissue gene
              expression data for predicting schizophrenia, (2)
              population-level genotype and gene expression data for predicting
              clinical phenotypes in Alzheimer's Disease, (3) gene expression
              and electrophysiological data of single neuronal cells in the
              mouse visual cortex, and (4) cell-type gene expression and
              genotype data for predicting schizophrenia. We found that
              DeepGAMI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and
              provides a profound understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms
              from genotype to phenotype, especially at cellular resolution.

  abstract = "The genetic etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders is highly
              heterogeneous. They are characterized by abnormalities in the
              development of the central nervous system, which lead to
              diminished physical or intellectual capabilities. Determining
              which gene is the driver of disease (not just a passenger),
              termed 'gene prioritization,' is not entirely known. In terms of
              disease-gene associations, genome-wide explorations are still
              underdeveloped due to the reliance on previous discoveries when
              spotting new genes and other evidence sources with false positive
              or false negative relations. This paper introduces DeepGenePrior,
              a model based on deep neural networks that prioritizes candidate
              genes in Copy Number Variant (CNV) mediated diseases. Based on
              the well-studied Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), we developed a
              score to measure the impact of the genes on the target diseases.
              Unlike other methods that use prior data on gene-disease
              associations to prioritize candidate genes (using the guilt by
              association principle), the current study exclusively relies on
              copy number variants. Therefore, the procedure can identify
              disease-associated genes regardless of prior knowledge or
              auxiliary data sources. We identified genes that distinguish
              cases from controls by analyzing CNVs from 74,811 individuals
              with three neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, schizophrenia,
              and developmental delay). A 12\% increase in fold enrichment was
              observed in brain-expressed genes compared to previous studies,
              while 15\% more fold enrichment was found in genes associated
              with mouse nervous system phenotypes. We also explored sex
              dimorphism for the disorders and discovered genes that
              overexpress more in one gender than the other. Additionally, we
              investigated the gene ontology of the putative genes with
              WebGestalt and the associations between the causative genes and
              the other phenotypes in the DECIPHER dataset. Furthermore, some
              genes were jointly present in the top genes associated with the
              three disorders in this study (i.e., autism spectrum disorder,
              schizophrenia, and developmental delay); namely, deletions in
              ZDHHC8, DGCR5, and CATG00000022283 were common between them.
              These findings suggest the common etiology of these clinically
              distinct conditions. With DeepGenePrior, we address the obstacles
              in existing gene prioritization studies. This study identified
              promising candidate genes without prior knowledge of diseases or

  abstract  = "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis
               that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data
               covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful
               scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information.
               PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like
               EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost
               analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal
               and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape
               study design, identify, and characterize individuals and
               populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions
               on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The
               replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate
               whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We
               analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based
               model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA
               results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily
               manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also
               yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results
               may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes.
               Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results
               reported in the population genetics literature and related
               fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes
               and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may
               have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that
               32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cancers are complex diseases with heterogeneous
              genetic causes and clinical outcomes. It is critical to classify
              patients into subtypes and associate the subtypes with clinical
              outcomes for better prognosis and treatment. Large-scale studies
              have comprehensively identified somatic mutations across multiple
              tumor types, providing rich datasets for classifying patients
              based on genomic mutations. One challenge associated with this
              task is that mutations are rarely shared across patients.
              Network-based stratification (NBS) approaches have been proposed
              to overcome this challenge and used to classify tumors based on
              exome-level mutations. In routine research and clinical
              applications, however, usually only a small panel of pre-selected
              genes is screened for mutations. It is unknown whether such small
              panels are effective in classifying patients into clinically
              meaningful subtypes. RESULTS: In this study, we applied NBS to 13
              major cancer types with exome-level mutation data and compared
              the classification based on the full exome data with those
              focusing only on small sets of genes. Specifically, we
              investigated three panels, FoundationOne (240 genes), PanCan (127
              genes) and TruSeq (48 genes). We showed that small panels not
              only are effective in clustering tumors but also often outperform
              full exome data for most cancer types. We further associated
              subtypes with clinical data and identified 5 tumor types
              (CRC-Colorectal carcinoma, HNSC-Head and neck squamous cell
              carcinoma, KIRC-Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, LUAD-Lung
              adenocarcinoma and UCEC-Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma)
              whose subtypes are significantly associated with overall
              survival, all based on small panels. CONCLUSION: Our analyses
              indicate that effective patient subtyping can be carried out
              using mutations detected in smaller gene panels, probably due to
              the enrichment of clinically important genes in such panels.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: With a growing amount of (multi-)omics data being
              available, the extraction of knowledge from these datasets is
              still a difficult problem. Classical enrichment-style analyses
              require predefined pathways or gene sets that are tested for
              significant deregulation to assess whether the pathway is
              functionally involved in the biological process under study. De
              novo identification of these pathways can reduce the bias
              inherent in predefined pathways or gene sets. At the same time,
              the definition and efficient identification of these pathways de
              novo from large biological networks is a challenging problem.
              RESULTS: We present a novel algorithm, DeRegNet, for the
              identification of maximally deregulated subnetworks on directed
              graphs based on deregulation scores derived from (multi-)omics
              data. DeRegNet can be interpreted as maximum likelihood
              estimation given a certain probabilistic model for de-novo
              subgraph identification. We use fractional integer programming to
              solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We can
              show that the approach outperforms related algorithms on
              simulated data with known ground truths. On a publicly available
              liver cancer dataset we can show that DeRegNet can identify
              biologically meaningful subgraphs suitable for patient
              stratification. DeRegNet can also be used to find explicitly
              multi-omics subgraphs which we demonstrate by presenting
              subgraphs with consistent methylation-transcription patterns.
              DeRegNet is freely available as open-source software. CONCLUSION:
              The proposed algorithmic framework and its available

               construction contains multiple feasible alternatives, including
               correlation-based approaches (Pearson's correlation and
               Spearman's rank correlation along with random matrix theory, and
               sparse correlations for compositional data) and conditional

               structures at different levels and the potential effects of
               environmental factors on network structures. Considering the

              is one of the most mutated genes in cancer and a major bladder

              contributes to tumorigenesis. Here, we analyze the genomic
              distribution of STAG1 and STAG2 and perform STAG2
              loss-of-function experiments using RT112 bladder cancer cells; we
              then analyze the genomic effects by integrating gene expression
              and chromatin interaction data. Functional compartmentalization
              exists between the cohesin complexes: cohesin-STAG2 displays a
              distinctive genomic distribution and mediates short and
              mid-ranged interactions that engage genes at higher frequency
              than those established by cohesin-STAG1. STAG2 knockdown results
              in down-regulation of the luminal urothelial signature and

              topological domains, while compartments and domain boundaries
              remain refractive. Contacts lost upon depletion of STAG2 are
              assortative, preferentially occur within silent chromatin
              domains, and are associated with de-repression of
              lineage-specifying genes. Our findings indicate that STAG2
              participates in the DNA looping that keeps the basal
              transcriptional program silent and thus sustains the luminal
              program. This mechanism may contribute to the tumor suppressor

  abstract = "Diseases can be caused by molecular perturbations that induce
              specific changes in regulatory interactions and their coordinated
              expression, also referred to as network rewiring. However, the
              detection of complex changes in regulatory connections remains a
              challenging task and would benefit from the development of novel
              non-parametric approaches. We developed a new ensemble method
              called BoostDiff (boosted differential regression trees) to infer
              a differential network discriminating between two conditions.
              BoostDiff builds an adaptively boosted (AdaBoost) ensemble of
              differential trees with respect to a target condition. To build
              the differential trees, we propose differential variance
              improvement as a novel splitting criterion. Variable importance
              measures derived from the resulting models are used to reflect
              changes in gene expression predictability and to build the output
              differential networks. BoostDiff outperforms existing
              differential network methods on simulated data evaluated in two
              different complexity settings. We then demonstrate the power of
              our approach when applied to real transcriptomics data in
              COVID-19 and Crohn's disease. BoostDiff identifies
              context-specific networks that are enriched with genes of known
              disease-relevant pathways and complements standard differential
              expression analyses. BoostDiff is available at . Author Summary
              Gene regulatory networks, which comprise the collection of
              regulatory relationships between transcription factors and their
              target genes, are important for controlling various molecular
              processes. Diseases can induce perturbations in normal gene
              co-expression patterns in these networks. Detecting
              differentially co-expressed or rewired edges between disease and
              healthy biological states can be thus useful for investigating
              the link between specific disease-associated molecular
              alterations and phenotype. We developed BoostDiff (boosted
              differential trees), an ensemble method to derive differential
              networks between two biological contexts. Our approach applies a
              boosting scheme using differential trees as base learner. A
              differential tree is a new tree structure that is built from two
              expression datasets using a splitting criterion called the
              differential variance improvement. The resulting BoostDiff model
              learns the most differentially predictive features which are then
              used to build the directed differential networks. BoostDiff
              outperforms other differential network methods on simulated data
              and outputs more biologically meaningful results when evaluated
              on real transcriptomics datasets. BoostDiff can be applied to
              gene expression data to reveal new disease mechanisms or identify
              potential therapeutic targets. \#\#\# Competing Interest

              problems is the identification of variables that are highly
              dependent on several other variables. When dependence is measured
              by partial correlations, these variables identify those rows of
              the partial correlation matrix that have several entries with
              large magnitudes, i.e., hubs in the associated partial
              correlation graph. This paper develops theory and algorithms for
              discovering such hubs from a few observations of these variables.
              We introduce a hub screening framework in which the user
              specifies both a minimum (partial) correlation $\rho $ and a
              minimum degree $\delta $ to screen the vertices. The choice of
              $\rho $ and $\delta $ can be guided by our mathematical
              expressions for the phase transition correlation threshold $\rho
              _c$ governing the average number of discoveries. They can also be
              guided by our asymptotic expressions for familywise discovery
              rates under the assumption of large number $p$ of variables,
              fixed number $n$ of multivariate samples, and weak dependence.
              Under the null hypothesis that the dispersion (covariance) matrix
              is sparse, these limiting expressions can be used to enforce
              familywise error constraints and to rank the discoveries in order

              computational complexity of the proposed partial correlation
              screening method is low and is therefore highly scalable. Thus,
              it can be applied to significantly larger problems than previous

              network differences. In this work, a novel method,
              permutation-based Network True Discovery Proportions (NetTDP), is
              proposed to quantify the number of edges (correlations) or nodes
              (genes) for which the co-expression networks are different. In
              the NetTDP method, we propose an edge-level statistic and a

              nodes in the sense of differential co-expression network,
              respectively, by the permutation-based sumSome method.
              Furthermore, the NetTDP method could further localize the

              for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
              algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
              largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
              arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
              communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the

              that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to
              16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene expression is regulated at different molecular
              levels, including chromatin accessibility, transcription, RNA
              maturation, and transport. These regulatory mechanisms have
              strong connections with cellular metabolism. In order to study
              the cellular system and its functioning, omics data at each
              molecular level can be generated and efficiently integrated.
              Here, we propose BRANENET, a novel multi-omics integration
              framework for multilayer heterogeneous networks. BRANENET is an
              expressive, scalable, and versatile method to learn node
              embeddings, leveraging random walk information within a matrix
              factorization framework. Our goal is to efficiently integrate
              multi-omics data to study different regulatory aspects of
              multilayered processes that occur in organisms. We evaluate our
              framework using multi-omics data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a
              well-studied yeast model organism. RESULTS: We test BRANENET on
              transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and targeted metabolomics (NMR) data
              for wild-type yeast strain during a heat-shock time course of 0,
              20, and 120 min. Our framework learns features for differentially
              expressed bio-molecules showing heat stress response. We
              demonstrate the applicability of the learned features for
              targeted omics inference tasks: transcription factor (TF)-target
              prediction, integrated omics network (ION) inference, and module
              identification. The performance of BRANENET is compared to
              existing network integration methods. Our model outperforms
              baseline methods by achieving high prediction scores for a
              variety of downstream tasks.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most biological experiments are inherently designed
              to compare changes or transitions of state between conditions of
              interest. The advancements in data intensive research have in
              particular elevated the need for resources and tools enabling
              comparative analysis of biological data. The complexity of
              biological systems and the interactions of their various
              components, such as genes, proteins, taxa, and metabolites, have
              been inferred, represented, and visualized via graph theory-based
              networks. Comparisons of multiple networks can help in
              identifying variations across different biological systems,
              thereby providing additional insights. However, while a number of
              online and stand-alone tools exist for generating, analyzing, and
              visualizing individual biological networks, the utility to batch
              process and comprehensively compare multiple networks is limited.
              RESULTS: Here, we present a graphical user interface (GUI)-based
              web application which implements multiple network comparison
              methodologies and presents them in the form of organized analysis
              workflows. Dedicated comparative visualization modules are
              provided to the end-users for obtaining easy to comprehend,
              insightful, and meaningful comparisons of various biological
              networks. We demonstrate the utility and power of our tool using
              publicly available microbial and gene expression data.
              CONCLUSION: NetConfer tool is developed keeping in mind the
              requirements of researchers working in the field of biological
              data analysis with limited programming expertise. It is also
              expected to be useful for advanced users from biological as well

              from provided ready-made workflows, as they allow to focus
              directly on the results without worrying about the
              implementation. While the web version allows using this
              application without installation and dependency requirements, a

              phenotypes results from changes to interactions in pre-existing
              biological networks and comparing networks across species can
              identify evidence of conservation or adaptation. Gene
              co-expression networks (GCNs), constructed from high-throughput
              gene expression data, can be used to understand evolution and the
              rise of new phenotypes. The increasing abundance of gene
              expression data makes GCNs a valuable tool for the study of
              evolution in non-model organisms. In this paper, we cover
              motivations for why comparing these networks across species can
              be valuable for the study of evolution. We also review techniques
              for comparing GCNs in the context of evolution, including local

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are not easily
              comparable due to their complex structure. In this paper, we
              propose a tool, Juxtapose, together with similarity measures that
              can be utilized for comparative transcriptomics between a set of
              organisms. While we focus on its application to comparing
              co-expression networks across species in evolutionary studies,
              Juxtapose is also generalizable to co-expression network
              comparisons across tissues or conditions within the same species.
              METHODS: A word embedding strategy commonly used in natural
              language processing was utilized in order to generate gene
              embeddings based on walks made throughout the GCNs. Juxtapose was
              evaluated based on its ability to embed the nodes of synthetic
              structures in the networks consistently while also generating
              biologically informative results. Evaluation of the techniques
              proposed in this research utilized RNA-seq datasets from GTEx, a
              multi-species experiment of prefrontal cortex samples from the
              Gene Expression Omnibus, as well as synthesized datasets.
              Biological evaluation was performed using gene set enrichment
              analysis and known gene relationships in literature. RESULTS: We
              show that Juxtapose is capable of globally aligning synthesized
              networks as well as identifying areas that are conserved in real
              gene co-expression networks without reliance on external
              biological information. Furthermore, output from a matching
              algorithm that uses cosine distance between GCN embeddings is
              shown to be an informative measure of similarity that reflects
              the amount of topological similarity between networks.
              CONCLUSIONS: Juxtapose can be used to align GCNs without relying
              on known biological similarities and enables post-hoc analyses
              using biological parameters, such as orthology of genes, or
              conserved or variable pathways. AVAILABILITY: A development

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene and protein interaction data are often
              represented as interaction networks, where nodes stand for genes
              or gene products and each edge stands for a relationship between
              a pair of gene nodes. Commonly, that relationship within a pair
              is specified by high similarity between profiles (vectors) of
              experimentally defined interactions of each of the two genes with
              all other genes in the genome; only gene pairs that interact with
              similar sets of genes are linked by an edge in the network. The
              tight groups of genes/gene products that work together in a cell
              can be discovered by the analysis of those complex networks.
              RESULTS: We show that the choice of the similarity measure
              between pairs of gene vectors impacts the properties of networks
              and of gene modules detected within them. We re-analyzed
              well-studied data on yeast genetic interactions, constructed four
              genetic networks using four different similarity measures, and
              detected gene modules in each network using the same algorithm.
              The four networks induced different numbers of putative
              functional gene modules, and each similarity measure induced some
              unique modules. In an example of a putative functional connection
              suggested by comparing genetic interaction vectors, we predict a
              link between SUN-domain proteins and protein glycosylation in the
              endoplasmic reticulum. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of molecular
              modules in genetic networks is sensitive to the way of measuring
              similarity between profiles of gene interactions in a cell. In
              the absence of a formal way to choose the ``best'' measure, it is
              advisable to explore the measures with different mathematical
              properties, which may identify different sets of connections
              between genes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Clustering methods are widely used on gene expression
              data to categorize genes with similar expression profiles.
              Finding an appropriate (dis)similarity measure is critical to the
              analysis. In our study, we developed a new measure for clustering
              the genes when the key factor is the shape of the profile, and
              when the expression magnitude should also be accounted for in
              determining the gene relationship. This is achieved by modeling
              the shape and magnitude parameters separately in a gene
              expression profile, and then using the estimated shape and
              magnitude parameters to define a measure in a new feature space.
              RESULTS: We explored several different transformation schemes to
              construct the feature spaces that include a space whose features
              are determined by the mutual differences of the original
              expression components, a space derived from a parametric
              covariance matrix, and the principal component space in
              traditional PCA analysis. The former two are the newly proposed
              and the latter is explored for comparison purposes. The new
              measures we defined in these feature spaces were employed in a
              K-means clustering procedure to perform analyses. Applying these
              algorithms to a simulation dataset, a developing mouse retina
              SAGE dataset, a small yeast sporulation cDNA dataset, and a maize
              root affymetrix microarray dataset, we found from the results
              that the algorithm associated with the first feature space, named
              TransChisq, showed clear advantages over other methods.
              CONCLUSION: The proposed TransChisq is very promising in
              capturing meaningful gene expression clusters. This study also
              demonstrates the importance of data transformations in defining
              an efficient distance measure. Our method should provide new
              insights in analyzing gene expression data. The clustering

  title    = "A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network
              analysis",
  author   = "Zhang, Bin and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the
              system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is
              conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are
              connected if the corresponding genes are significantly
              co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In
              reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes
              in such networks. An important question is whether it is
              biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary
              information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general
              framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection
              weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a
              weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we
              propose several adjacency functions that convert the
              co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the
              parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically
              motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology
              criterion). We generalize the following important network
              concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce
              several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence
              that they can be important for predicting the biological
              significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and
              empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap
              measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive
              modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize
              the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the
              unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering
              coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We
              provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between
              clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard
              thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer
              microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.",

  author   = "Zhang, Fan and Hu, Wei and Liu, Yirong",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The main focus of in silico drug repurposing, which
              is a promising area for using artificial intelligence in drug
              discovery, is the prediction of drug-disease relationships.
              Although many computational models have been proposed recently,
              it is still difficult to reliably predict drug-disease
              associations from a variety of sources of data. RESULTS: In order
              to identify potential drug-disease associations, this paper
              introduces a novel end-to-end model called Graph convolution
              network based on a multimodal attention mechanism (GCMM). In
              particular, GCMM incorporates known drug-disease relations,
              drug-drug chemical similarity, drug-drug therapeutic similarity,
              disease-disease semantic similarity, and disease-disease
              target-based similarity into a heterogeneous network. A Graph
              Convolution Network encoder is used to learn how diseases and
              drugs are embedded in various perspectives. Additionally, GCMM
              can enhance performance by applying a multimodal attention layer
              to assign various levels of value to various features and the
              inputting of multi-source information. CONCLUSION: 5 fold
              cross-validation evaluations show that the GCMM outperforms four
              recently proposed deep-learning models on the majority of the
              criteria. It shows that GCMM can predict drug-disease
              relationships reliably and suggests improvement in the desired
              metrics. Hyper-parameter analysis and exploratory ablation
              experiments are also provided to demonstrate the necessity of

              have the highest potential correlation coefficient with AD have
              been demonstrated through literature or experimental research,
              demonstrating the viability of GCMM. All of these results imply

                   advancements in deep learning, methods utilizing graph
                   representation learning and deep clustering have shown great
                   results in community detection. However, these methods often
                   rely on the topology of networks (i) ignoring important
                   features such as network heterogeneity, temporality,
                   multimodality, and other possibly relevant features.
                   Besides, (ii) the number of communities is not known a
                   priori and is often left to model selection. In addition,
                   (iii) in multimodal networks all nodes are assumed to be

                   of communities in tandem. In order to assess its

              has favored the generation of large-scale disparate data and the
              consequent demand for simultaneously using molecular and
              functional interaction networks: gene co-expression,
              protein-protein interaction (PPI), genetic interaction, and
              metabolic networks. They are rich sources of information at
              different molecular levels, and their effective integration is
              essential to understand cell functioning and their building

              demonstrate the applicability of the learned features for
              essential multi-omics inference tasks: clustering, function and
              PPI prediction. We compare it to state-of-the-art integration

  abstract = "AI is remarkably successful and outperforms human experts in
              certain tasks, even in complex domains such as medicine. Humans
              on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can
              embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge
              space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build
              systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive
              what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are
              becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI).
              Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a
              guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable,
              more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able
              to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical
              domain is that various modalities contribute to one single
              result. Our main question is ``How can we construct a multi-modal
              feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics
              data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the
              development of novel explanation interface techniques?''. In this
              paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a
              method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal
              causability (causability -- not to confuse with causality -- is
              the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert
              achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of
              this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to
              further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and
              interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective
              future human--AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural
              Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since
              causal links between features can be defined directly using graph
              structures.",

                   subgraphs. However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph
                   classification and clustering require representing entire

                   effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph

              from 114,000 in 1990. Moreover, with the emergence of multi-omics
              data, more comprehensive analysis of human diseases become
              possible. In this study, we propose a multi-step approach for the
              identification of BC-related genes by using integrative
              Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-Omics data (iHNMMO). The
              heterogeneous network model properly and comprehensively reflects
              the multiple kinds of relationships between genes in the
              multi-omics data of BC, including general relationships, unique
              relationships under BC condition, correlational relationships
              within each omics and regulatory relationships between different

              resistance is utilized to quantize the relationships between
              genes and BC precisely. The results of comprehensive performance

  abstract = "The bladder is an important tissue in which to evaluate
              xenobiotic drug interactions and toxicities due to the
              concentration of parent drug and hepatic/enteric-derived
              metabolites in the urine as a result of renal excretion.
              Breaching of the barrier provided by the bladder epithelial
              lining (the urothelium) can expose the underlying tissues to
              urine and cause harmful effects (e.g., cystitis or cancer). Human
              urothelium is most commonly represented in vitro as immortalized
              or established cancer-derived cell lines, but the compromised
              ability of such cells to undergo differentiation and barrier
              formation means that nonimmortalized, normal human urothelial
              (NHU) cells provide a more relevant cell culture system. The
              impressive capacity for urothelial self-renewal in vivo can be
              harnessed in vitro to generate experimentally-useful quantities
              of NHU cells, which can subsequently be differentiated to form a
              functional or ``biomimetic'' urothelium. When seeded onto
              permeable membranes, these barrier-forming human urothelial
              tissue models enable the modeling of serum and luminal
              (intravesical) exposure to drugs and metabolites, thus supporting
              efficacy/toxicity assessments. Biomimetic human urothelial
              constructs provide a potential step along the preclinical trail
              and may support the extrapolation from rodent in vivo data to
              determine human relevance. Early evidence is beginning to

              This paper presents an approach based on topic modeling to

              Leveraging on this analogy, a new class of topic modeling

              extremely high connectivity), and this pattern is unique to the
              corresponding cancer-type-specific network. In contrast, the
              prognostic genes are enriched in modules (a group of highly
              interconnected genes), especially in module genes conserved
              across different cancer co-expression networks. The target genes
              of prognostic miRNA genes show similar patterns. We identified
              the modules enriched in various prognostic genes, some of which

              profiling in heart is a central issue to better understand
              cardiac physiology and diseases. Although significant progress
              has been made in genome-wide profiling for quantitative changes
              in cardiac gene expression, current knowledge offers limited
              insights to the total complexity in cardiac transcriptome at
              individual exon level. OBJECTIVE: To develop more robust
              bioinformatic approaches to analyze high-throughput RNA
              sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, with the focus on the investigation of
              transcriptome complexity at individual exon and transcript
              levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: In addition to overall gene
              expression analysis, the methods developed in this study were
              used to analyze RNA-Seq data with respect to individual
              transcript isoforms, novel spliced exons, novel alternative
              terminal exons, novel transcript clusters (ie, novel genes), and
              long noncoding RNA genes. We applied these approaches to RNA-Seq
              data obtained from mouse hearts after pressure-overload-induced
              by transaortic constriction. Based on experimental validations,
              analyses of the features of the identified exons/transcripts, and
              expression analyses including previously published RNA-Seq data,
              we demonstrate that the methods are highly effective in detecting
              and quantifying individual exons and transcripts. Novel insights
              inferred from the examined aspects of the cardiac transcriptome
              open ways to further experimental investigations. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our work provided a comprehensive set of methods to analyze mouse
              cardiac transcriptome complexity at individual exon and
              transcript levels. Applications of the methods may infer
              important new insights to gene regulation in normal and disease

              association with various diseases, like type 2 diabetes,
              resulting in major public health and economic implications.
              Obesity is the result of environmental and genetic factors and
              their interactions, including genome-wide genetic interactions.
              Identification of co-expressed and regulatory genes in RNA
              extracted from relevant tissues representing lean and obese
              individuals provides an entry point for the identification of
              genes and pathways of importance to the development of obesity.
              The pig, an omnivorous animal, is an excellent model for human
              obesity, offering the possibility to study in-depth organ-level
              transcriptomic regulations of obesity, unfeasible in humans. Our
              aim was to reveal adipose tissue co-expression networks, pathways
              and transcriptional regulations of obesity using RNA Sequencing
              based systems biology approaches in a porcine model. METHODS: We
              selected 36 animals for RNA Sequencing from a previously created
              F2 pig population representing three extreme groups based on
              their predicted genetic risks for obesity. We applied Weighted
              Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to detect clusters of
              highly co-expressed genes (modules). Additionally, regulator
              genes were detected using Lemon-Tree algorithms. RESULTS: WGCNA
              revealed five modules which were strongly correlated with at
              least one obesity-related phenotype (correlations ranging from
              -0.54 to 0.72, P < 0.001). Functional annotation identified
              pathways enlightening the association between obesity and other
              diseases, like osteoporosis (osteoclast differentiation, P =
              1.4E-7), and immune-related complications (e.g. Natural killer
              cell mediated cytotoxity, P = 3.8E-5; B cell receptor signaling
              pathway, P = 7.2E-5). Lemon-Tree identified three potential
              regulator genes, using confident scores, for the WGCNA module
              which was associated with osteoclast differentiation: CCR1, MSR1
              and SI1 (probability scores respectively 95.30, 62.28, and
              34.58). Moreover, detection of differentially connected genes
              identified various genes previously identified to be associated
              with obesity in humans and rodents, e.g. CSF1R and MARC2.

              systems biology approaches using porcine adipose tissue
              RNA-Sequencing data in a genetically characterized porcine model
              for obesity. We revealed complex networks, pathways, candidate
              and regulatory genes related to obesity, confirming the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Extensive biomedical studies have shown that clinical
              and environmental risk factors may not have sufficient predictive
              power for cancer prognosis. The development of high-throughput
              profiling technologies makes it possible to survey the whole
              genome and search for genomic markers with predictive power. Many
              existing studies assume the interchangeability of gene effects
              and ignore the coordination among them. RESULTS: We adopt the
              weighted co-expression network to describe the interplay among
              genes. Although there are several different ways of defining gene
              networks, the weighted co-expression network may be preferred
              because of its computational simplicity, satisfactory empirical
              performance, and because it does not demand additional biological
              experiments. For cancer prognosis studies with gene expression
              measurements, we propose a new marker selection method that can
              properly incorporate the network connectivity of genes. We
              analyze six prognosis studies on breast cancer and lymphoma. We
              find that the proposed approach can identify genes that are
              significantly different from those using alternatives. We search
              published literature and find that genes identified using the
              proposed approach are biologically meaningful. In addition, they
              have better prediction performance and reproducibility than genes
              identified using alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: The network contains
              important information on the functionality of genes.

              divided into two molecular subtypes referred to as luminal and
              basal with distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to
              chemotherapy. We aimed to validate these subtypes in several
              clinical cohorts and identify signature immunohistochemical
              markers that would permit simple and cost-effective
              classification of the disease in primary care centers. METHODS:
              We analyzed genomic expression profiles of bladder cancer in
              three cohorts of fresh frozen tumor samples: MD Anderson (n=132),
              Lund (n=308), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=408) to
              validate the expression signatures of luminal and basal subtypes
              and relate them to clinical follow-up data. We also used an MD
              Anderson cohort of archival bladder tumor samples (n=89) and a
              parallel tissue microarray to identify immunohistochemical
              markers that permitted the molecular classification of bladder
              cancer. FINDINGS: Bladder cancers could be assigned to two
              candidate intrinsic molecular subtypes referred to here as
              luminal and basal in all of the datasets analyzed. Luminal tumors
              were characterized by the expression signature similar to the
              intermediate/superficial layers of normal urothelium. They showed
              the upregulation of PPAR$\gamma$ target genes and the enrichment
              for FGFR3, ELF3, CDKN1A, and TSC1 mutations. In addition, luminal
              tumors were characterized by the overexpression of E-Cadherin,
              HER2/3, Rab-25, and Src. Basal tumors showed the expression
              signature similar to the basal layer of normal urothelium. They
              showed the upregulation of p63 target genes, the enrichment for
              TP53 and RB1 mutations, and overexpression of CD49, Cyclin B1,
              and EGFR. Survival analyses showed that the muscle-invasive basal
              bladder cancers were more aggressive when compared to luminal
              cancers. The immunohistochemical expressions of only two markers,
              luminal (GATA3) and basal (KRT5/6), were sufficient to identify
              the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer with over 90\% accuracy.
              INTERPRETATION: The molecular subtypes of bladder cancer have
              distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy,
              and a simple two-marker immunohistochemical classifier can be
              used for prognostic and therapeutic stratification. FUNDING: U.S.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with
              many possible genetic and environmental causes. The same
              treatment for patients of the same cancer type often results in
              different outcomes in terms of efficacy and side effects of the
              treatment. Thus, the molecular characterization of individual
              cancer patients is increasingly important to find an effective
              treatment. Recently a few methods have been developed to
              construct cancer sample-specific gene networks based on the
              difference in the mRNA expression levels between the cancer
              sample and reference samples. METHODS: We constructed a
              patient-specific network with multi-omics data based on the
              difference between a reference network and a perturbed reference
              network by the patient. A network specific to a group of patients
              was obtained using the average change in correlation coefficients
              and node degree of patient-specific networks of the group.
              RESULTS: In this paper, we present a new method for constructing
              cancer patient-specific and group-specific gene networks with
              multi-omics data. The main differences of our method from
              previous ones are as follows: (1) networks are constructed with
              multi-omics (mRNA expression, copy number variation, DNA
              methylation and microRNA expression) data rather than with mRNA
              expression data alone, (2) background networks are constructed
              with both normal samples and cancer samples of the specified type
              to extract cancer-specific gene correlations, and (3) both
              patient individual-specific networks and patient group-specific
              networks can be constructed. The results of evaluating our method
              with several types of cancer show that it constructs more
              informative and accurate gene networks than previous methods.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results of evaluating our method with extensive
              data of seven cancer types show that the difference of gene
              correlations between the reference samples and a patient sample
              is a more predictive feature than mRNA expression levels and that
              gene networks constructed with multi-omics data show a better
              performance than those with single omics data in predicting
              cancer for most cancer types. Our approach will be useful for
              finding genes and gene pairs to tailor treatments to individual

              and muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC) and it depends on
              the extent to which tumor has infiltrated the bladder wall and
              other tissues and organs. NMIBC and MIBC exhibit great intrinsic
              heterogeneity regarding different prognoses, survival,
              progression, and treatment outcomes. In recent years, studies
              based on mRNA expression profiling revealed the existence of

              molecular subtypes of NMIBC and MIBC in detail with regard to
              different mRNA expression profiles, mutational signatures, and
              infiltration by non-tumor cells. The possible impact of molecular

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Gene expression-based multiclass prediction, such as
              tumor subtyping, is a non-trivial bioinformatic problem. Most
              classifier methods operate by comparing expression levels
              relative to other samples. Methods that base predictions on the
              expression pattern within a sample have been proposed as an
              alternative. As these methods are invariant to the cohort
              composition and can be applied to a sample in isolation, they can
              collectively be termed single sample predictors (SSP). Such
              predictors could potentially be used for preprocessing-free
              classification of new samples and be built to function across
              different expression platforms where proper batch and dataset
              normalization is challenging. Here, we evaluate the behavior of
              several multiclass SSPs based on binary gene-pair rules (k-Top
              Scoring Pairs, Absolute Intrinsic Molecular Subtyping and a new
              Random Forest approach) and compare them to centroids built with
              centered or raw expression values, with the criteria that an
              optimal predictor should have high accuracy, overcome differences
              in tumor purity, be robust across expression platforms and
              provide an informative prediction output score. RESULTS: We found
              that gene-pair-based SSPs showed excellent performance on many
              expression-based classification tasks. The three methods differed
              in prediction score output, handling of tied scores and behavior
              in low purity samples. The k-Top Scoring Pairs and Random Forest
              approach both achieved high classification accuracy while
              providing an informative prediction score. Although
              gene-pair-based SSPs have been touted as being cross-platform
              compatible (through training on mixed platform data),
              out-of-the-box compatibility with a new dataset remains a
              potential issue that warrants cohort-to-cohort verification.

              biochemical interactions from large-scale observations, such as
              transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We propose to use a
              partial correlation analysis to construct approximate Undirected
              Dependency Graphs from such large-scale biochemical data. This
              approach enables a distinction between direct and indirect
              interactions of biochemical compounds, thereby inferring the
              underlying network topology. RESULTS: The method is first
              thoroughly evaluated with a large set of simulated data. Results
              indicate that the approach has good statistical power and a low
              False Discovery Rate even in the presence of noise in the data.
              We then applied the method to an existing data set of yeast gene
              expression. Several small gene networks were inferred and found
              to contain genes known to be collectively involved in particular
              biochemical processes. In some of these networks there are also
              uncharacterized ORFs present, which lead to hypotheses about
              their functions. AVAILABILITY: Programs running in MS-Windows and

              over the years. While modularity remains one of the more popular
              methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit
              remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was
              recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a
              random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be
              compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is
              meant exactly by ``resolution-limit-free,'' that is, not
              suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question
              remains what other methods could be classified as
              resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous
              definition and derive some basic properties of
              resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to
              prove exactly which class of community detection methods are
              resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are
              not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited
              scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods.

              propose that directly contrasting the contributions of these two

                   attracted a significant amount of attention over the past
                   decades. This area deals with the automated division of a
                   network into fundamental building blocks, with the objective
                   of providing a summary of its large-scale structure. Despite
                   its importance and widespread adoption, there is a
                   noticeable gap between what is arguably the state-of-the-art
                   and the methods that are actually used in practice in a
                   variety of fields. Here we attempt to address this
                   discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to
                   whether they have a ``descriptive'' or an ``inferential''
                   goal. While descriptive methods find patterns in networks
                   based on context-dependent notions of community structure,
                   inferential methods articulate generative models, and
                   attempt to fit them to data. In this way, they are able to
                   provide insights into the mechanisms of network formation,
                   and separate structure from randomness in a manner supported
                   by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive
                   methods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and
                   misleading answers, and thus should be in general avoided.
                   We argue that inferential methods are more typically aligned
                   with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust
                   results, and should be in many cases preferred. We attempt
                   to dispel some myths and half-truths often believed when
                   community detection is employed in practice, in an effort to

                   conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or
                   independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle
                   to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem
                   is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $O(N^2)$,
                   corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise

                   reconstruction problems that achieves its result in
                   subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely

              (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is the most detailed and
              comprehensive resource for exploring the effect of somatic
              mutations in human cancer. The latest release, COSMIC v86 (August
              2018), includes almost 6 million coding mutations across 1.4
              million tumour samples, curated from over 26 000 publications. In
              addition to coding mutations, COSMIC covers all the genetic
              mechanisms by which somatic mutations promote cancer, including
              non-coding mutations, gene fusions, copy-number variants and
              drug-resistance mutations. COSMIC is primarily hand-curated,
              ensuring quality, accuracy and descriptive data capture. Building
              on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new
              initiatives that allow us to prioritize key genes and diseases,
              and to react more quickly and comprehensively to new findings in
              the literature. Alongside improvements to the public website and
              data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows
              exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein
              structures, their protein structural and functional impacts, and
              implications for druggability. In parallel with COSMIC's deep and
              broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) describes a
              curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer.
              Currently describing 719 genes, the CGC has recently introduced
              functional descriptions of how each gene drives disease,
              summarized into the 10 cancer Hallmarks.",
