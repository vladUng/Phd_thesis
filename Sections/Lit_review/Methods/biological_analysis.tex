\subsection{Gene analysis} \label{s:lit:gene_analysis}


% Introduce the methods
Throughout the project there are used different methods to find \acrfull{mibc} subgroups from the network approach followed by the clustering analysis (\cref{s:N_I,s:N_II}) or by just applying clustering models in \cref{s:clustering_analysis}. In all cases there are new subgroups that require interpretation with the goal to both biologically validate as well as to find new markers or functions. To achieve this three methods are used: \acrfull{dea}, pi-plots and \acrfull{gsea} which are all covered in the following subsections. 

% Highlight the flow
% Who introduced the method
The \acrshort{dea} is the most important tool as it allows to determine the genes that are specific to a subtype compare to the other. The values derived are used to create the Volcano plots, see \cref{s:lit:dea}, allowing statistical analysis of the gene expression between two groups. The results of the \acrshort{dea} can also be used to compute the pi-values \citep{Xiao2014-zn} which allows the comparison of four groups in one plot; see \cref{s:lit:pi}. Subsequently, the pi-value plots can be used to compute ranking for specific groups which can then be used to perform \acrlong{gsea}; see \cref{s:lit:gsea}.


% DEA
\subsubsection{Volcano plot} \label{s:lit:dea}


% Intro to the volcano plot
The project employed the sleuth method from \citeauthor{Pimentel2017-xp} to perform differential expression analysis between two sample groups. This method takes as input a file containing the samples, their cluster labels, and the paths to the raw RNAseq reads. It returns the \textit{p} and \textit{q} (corrected p-value) values for each gene, indicating the significance of the expression differences.

% How the Volcano figure is constructed
The $-log_{10}$ transformed \textit{p}-values constitute the Y-axis in a volcano plot, while the X-axis displays the $log_{2}$ transformed fold-change in gene expression between the two groups. This means that the volcano plot, as shown in \cref{fig:lit:dea_eg}, displays the magnitude of gene expression change on the horizontal axis and the significance of that change on the vertical axis.

% Interpretation
In the example Volcano plot from \cref{fig:lit:dea_eg}, the two sides of the plot represent the two compared subgroups: subtype 1 on the right-hand side and subtype 2 on the left-hand side. The further up a gene is on the left side, the more differentially expressed it is in subtype 1, e.g., "Gene A" or "Gene P." Conversely, "Gene M" is specific to subtype 2. "Gene L" is an example of a gene that has higher expression in subtype 1 but is not significantly expressed.

The scale of the axes is particularly important, especially for the horizontal axis, where larger differences in gene expression lead to a larger scale. The vertical dotted lines represent the threshold $[-1, 1]$, which for $log_{2}$ transformed values, indicates a doubling or halving of gene expression. The "Point(s) of interest" are those that lie outside these lines, while the points in dark blue indicate genes with no significant expression difference between the two groups.

In summary, the volcano plot is a powerful tool for identifying genes that have both a large expression difference (X-axis) and a statistically significant difference (Y-axis). The plot was used to analyse the Abs-Ca differentiated split tumours in \cref{fig:N_II:diff_split} and the fresh-sequenced samples (P0) in \cref{fig:N_II:p0_split}.

\end{figure}


% Pi 
\subsubsection{Pi plot} \label{s:lit:pi}

% Introduce to pi
The volcano plots are a great tool to understand the gene expression differences between two groups but are limited to the comparison size. To account for that \cite{Xiao2014-zn} introduced a new metric, pi-values (or $\pi$), which combines both the significance and the gene expression difference in one value using \cref{eq:lit:pi_val}. The $q-value$ represents the significance of the expression difference (from sleuth), and the $FC$ denotes the fold-change between the two compared groups. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lit:pi_val}
    pi = - log_{10}(q_{val}) * log_{2}(FC)
\end{equation} 

% Describe the comparison
By compressing the \acrshort{dea} results into one score enables four group comparison, two on each of the axis of a scatter plot as seen in \cref{fig:lit:pi_eg}. The X-axis holds the pi values for subtype 4 on the positive and subtype 3 on the negative side. On the vertical axis the positive side marks points for subtype 1 and negative for subtype 2. As in the case with the Volcano plots, the scale of the axis is important and denotes the strength in the difference between the compared groups. This is highlighted by difference in shape by the coloured rectangles which are all within $+/-5\%$ of the axes and are a visual cue for the genes that are very close to the axis.

% Talk about the quadrant
As indicated by coloured rectangles, in \cref{fig:lit:pi_eg}, the closer to the axis a point is the more specific to that group is. The values between the coloured rectangles are part of a quadrant, starting from the right corner are marked by Roman numbers (I, II, III, IV) represents the specific between two groups; shown in green text. For example, "Gene C" is specific to both subtype 4 and 2, whereas "Gene E" to groups 2 and 3. 

The pi-plots were extensively used in the project starting with the analysis of the MIBC groups from \cref{s:cs:bio_interp}, to the subtypes founds using a subset of \acrlong{tf}s in \cref{s:N_I:sel_pruning} and the clusters derived with the latest version of the network approach in \cref{s:N_II:dea_rwd}.

% GSEA
\subsubsection{Gene Set Enrichment Analysis} \label{s:lit:gsea}

% Introduction to GSEA
The volcano and pi plots introduced earlier are tools to identify genes specific to different groups but usually there are still many genes left to explored. \acrfull{gsea} is another tool that can be used to find biologically relevant groups of genes which are different in the DEA. 

% How GSEA works
GSEA works by ranking all genes in your dataset according to a predefined metric (such as expression level or statistical significance) and then assessing whether the members of a given gene set (e.g., from the REACTOME database) are randomly distributed throughout the ranked list or primarily found at the top or bottom. If many of the high-ranked genes correspond to the top genes in a REACTOME pathway, it indicates positive enrichment of that pathway. Conversely, if many lower-ranked genes match the top genes in a REACTOME pathway, it suggests that the pathway is depleted in the given group.

% Ranking system
In the pi-plot from \cref{fig:lit:pi_eg}, quadrant I represents genes specific to the subtype 1 and subtype 2. To determine whether any of these genes are enriched in a REACTOME pathway, they must first be ranked. The blue cross, referred to as the 'Ref point,' represents the referential point, which consists of the maximum value on the X-axis (the most significantly expressed in subtype 4 over subtype 3) and the maximum on the Y-axis (the most significantly expressed gene in comparison subtype 1 over group 2). This point thus represents the 'most significantly expressed' coordinates across the two comparisons. The distances of all other points from this referential marker are computed, and the genes are then ranked.

    \caption[GSEA plot example]{Enrichment for the analysis in \cref{fig:cs:lumInf} used in the background chapter to showcase the \acrshort{gsea} . The group studied is the Luminal Infiltrated (LumInf) in quadrant III.}
    \label{fig:lit:gsea_eg}
\end{figure}

% Introduce the plot
The ranking system orders the genes in the pi-plot according to their expression difference and statistical significance. The ordered genes are then inputted to the GSEApy software which searches for pathways in the REACTOME database, producing a figure like \cref{fig:lit:gsea_eg}. 

% Describe the plot
The enrichment plot in \cref{fig:lit:gsea_eg} consists of two figures that share the same X-axis, which represents the gene ranking in ascending order, with the lowest-ranked gene closest to the referential point. The top figure plots the enrichment score (left Y-axis) of the pathways identified, while the bottom figure indicates the positions of the matched genes in the rank. The enrichment plot highlights the top 10 pathways with the highest enrichment scores, all of which have a significance level below 0.05. It is worth noting that the pathway names are abbreviated and trimmed (the "REACTOME" prefix removed) to fit the legend.

% Interpret the plot
Overall, the \acrshort{gsea} shows that Subtype 1 and Subtype 4 exhibit immune markers. The interpretation of enrichment analysis is performed by considering the collection of pathways identified rather than focusing on individual pathways. This is because genes can have different functions across various pathways, making it challenging to isolate a single pathway. For example, in \cref{fig:lit:gsea_eg}, multiple pathways are involved in immune-related functions, such as \textit{"FCCR Activation"}, \textit{"CD22 Mediated BCR Regulation"}, and \textit{"Antigen Activates B Cell Receptor..."}. 

The GSEA was used to complement the Pi and Volcano plots in the second results chapter, \cref{s:N_I:sel_pruning}, where the subtypes were derived using a subset of \acrlong{tf}. In this project, \acrfull{gsea} was run using the GSEApy package \citep{Fang2023-ec} and the REACTOME database \cite{Milacic2024-yt}\footnote{The Reactome version \textit{c2.cp.reactome.v2023.2.Hs.symbols} was used in this project.}.


\subsection{Survival Analysis} \label{s:lit:survival}

% Introduce the plot
This project employs Kaplan-Meier survival analysis \cite{Kaplan1958-iy} to estimate the survival prognosis of patients in different MIBC groups. The metadata from \acrlong{tcga} and the lifelines package \citep{Davidson-Pilon2019-fu} are used to compute the survival statistics, as shown in the plot in \cref{fig:lit:surival_eg}.

% Present the figure
\Cref{fig:lit:surival_eg} represents the Kaplan-Meier analysis of the MIBC groups identified using the selective edge pruning method described in \cref{s:N_I:sel_pruning}. The Y-axis shows the probability of survival over time (in months), which is displayed on the X-axis for a period of five years. Each marker represents an observation of a patient's survival information, and the p-value is computed using a multivariate log-rank test, which allows for the determination of the significance of survival differences between more than two groups.

% Interpret the plot
The plot in \cref{fig:lit:surival_eg} indicates that patients in group 5 have the lowest survival prognosis, while those in group 13 have a better prognosis. The Kaplan-Meier survival plot is a valuable tool for assessing the significance of the new groups. In this case, all but 15\% of the patients in group 5 are deceased after 20 months, highlighting the potential impact of understanding this group on improving outcomes for bladder cancer patients.

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used extensively throughout the project, beginning with the cluster analysis in \cref{s:clustering_analysis}, as shown in \cref{fig:cs:basal_survival,fig:cs:overview_survival}, followed by the selective edge pruning work in \cref{s:N_I:sel_pruning}, as illustrated in \cref{fig:N_I:sel_tfs_survival}, and finally in assessing the prognosis of the MIBC subtypes using the most advanced network configuration in \cref{s:N_II}, as presented in \cref{fig:N_II:survival_K_7}.
