\section{Literature Review}

There are two main goals here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce the reader to some of the concepts used in the project. The information that will come here will depend on the examiners and their background, but it is very likely that there are going to be two streams:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Genetics: gene expression, mutations, transcription factors, pathways etc
        \item Computational methods: clustering, dimension reduction (PCA, non-matrix factorisation etc), graphs etc 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Present the previous work done in the field(s):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stratification using RNAseq/Mutations
        \item Integrative approaches such as iCluster
        \item Network approaches in molecular biology  
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This section will be a combination of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Literature Review -- which is covering the stratification based on RNAseq or Mutations and some work done on multi-omics
    \item Notes on the network approaches and multi-omics
\end{itemize}
