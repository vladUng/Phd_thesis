  abstract  = "The molecular landscape in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
               (NMIBC) is characterized by large biological heterogeneity with
               variable clinical outcomes. Here, we perform an integrative
               multi-omics analysis of patients diagnosed with NMIBC (n = 834).
               Transcriptomic analysis identifies four classes (1, 2a, 2b and
               3) reflecting tumor biology and disease aggressiveness. Both
               transcriptome-based subtyping and the level of chromosomal
               instability provide independent prognostic value beyond
               established prognostic clinicopathological parameters. High
               chromosomal instability, p53-pathway disruption and
               APOBEC-related mutations are significantly associated with
               transcriptomic class 2a and poor outcome. RNA-derived immune
               cell infiltration is associated with chromosomally unstable
               tumors and enriched in class 2b. Spatial proteomics analysis
               confirms the higher infiltration of class 2b tumors and
               demonstrates an association between higher immune cell
               infiltration and lower recurrence rates. Finally, the
               independent prognostic value of the transcriptomic classes is
               documented in 1228 validation samples using a single sample
               classification tool. The classifier provides a framework for
               biomarker discovery and for optimizing treatment and
               surveillance in next-generation clinical trials.",

                   processes in complex dynamical systems",

  abstract      = "We introduce a notion of emergence for coarse-grained
                   macroscopic variables associated with highly-multivariate
                   microscopic dynamical processes, in the context of a coupled
                   dynamical environment. Dynamical independence instantiates
                   the intuition of an emergent macroscopic process as one
                   possessing the characteristics of a dynamical system ``in
                   its own right'', with its own dynamical laws distinct from
                   those of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We quantify
                   (departure from) dynamical independence by a
                   transformation-invariant Shannon information-based measure
                   of dynamical dependence. We emphasise the data-driven
                   discovery of dynamically-independent macroscopic variables,
                   and introduce the idea of a multiscale ``emergence
                   portrait'' for complex systems. We show how dynamical
                   dependence may be computed explicitly for linear systems via
                   state-space modelling, in both time and frequency domains,
                   facilitating discovery of emergent phenomena at all
                   spatiotemporal scales. We discuss application of the
                   state-space operationalisation to inference of the emergence
                   portrait for neural systems from neurophysiological
                   time-series data. We also examine dynamical independence for
                   discrete- and continuous-time deterministic dynamics, with
                   potential application to Hamiltonian mechanics and classical
                   complex systems such as flocking and cellular automata.",

@ARTICLE{Shadmehr2020-rd,
  title    = "Population coding in the cerebellum: a machine learning
              perspective",
  author   = "Shadmehr, Reza",
  abstract = "The cere resembles a feedforward, three-layer network of neurons
              in which the ``hidden layer'' consists of Purkinje cells
              (P-cells) and the output layer consists of deep cerebellar
              nucleus (DCN) neurons. In this analogy, the output of each DCN
              neuron is a prediction that is compared with the actual
              observation, resulting in an error signal that originates in the
              inferior olive. Efficient learning requires that the error signal
              reach the DCN neurons, as well as the P-cells that project onto
              them. However, this basic rule of learning is violated in the
              cerebellum: the olivary projections to the DCN are weak,
              particularly in adulthood. Instead, an extraordinarily strong
              signal is sent from the olive to the P-cells, producing complex
              spikes. Curiously, P-cells are grouped into small populations
              that converge onto single DCN neurons. Why are the P-cells
              organized in this way, and what is the membership criterion of
              each population? Here, I apply elementary mathematics from
              machine learning and consider the fact that P-cells that form a
              population exhibit a special property: they can synchronize their
              complex spikes, which in turn suppress activity of DCN neuron
              they project to. Thus complex spikes cannot only act as a
              teaching signal for a P-cell, but through complex spike
              synchrony, a P-cell population may act as a surrogate teacher for
              the DCN neuron that produced the erroneous output. It appears
              that grouping of P-cells into small populations that share a
              preference for error satisfies a critical requirement of
              efficient learning: providing error information to the output
              layer neuron (DCN) that was responsible for the error, as well as
              the hidden layer neurons (P-cells) that contributed to it. This
              population coding may account for several remarkable features of
              behavior during learning, including multiple timescales,
              protection from erasure, and spontaneous recovery of memory.",

  abstract = "Single-cell molecular tools have been developed at an incredible
              pace over the last five years as sequencing costs continue to
              drop and numerous molecular assays have been coupled to
              sequencing readouts. This rapid period of technological
              development has facilitated the delineation of individual
              molecular characteristics including the genome, transcriptome,
              epigenome, and proteome of individual cells, leading to an
              unprecedented resolution of the molecular networks governing
              complex biological systems. The immense power of single-cell
              molecular screens has been particularly highlighted through work
              in systems where cellular heterogeneity is a key feature, such as
              stem cell biology, immunology, and tumor cell biology.
              Single-cell-omics technologies have already contributed to the
              identification of novel disease biomarkers, cellular subsets,
              therapeutic targets and diagnostics, many of which would have
              been undetectable by bulk sequencing approaches. More recently,
              efforts to integrate single-cell multi-omics with single cell
              functional output and/or physical location have been challenging
              but have led to substantial advances. Perhaps most excitingly,
              there are emerging opportunities to reach beyond the description
              of static cellular states with recent advances in modulation of
              cells through CRISPR technology, in particular with the
              development of base editors which greatly raises the prospect of
              cell and gene therapies. In this review, we provide a brief
              overview of emerging single-cell technologies and discuss current
              developments in integrating single-cell molecular screens and
              performing single-cell multi-omics for clinical applications. We
              also discuss how single-cell molecular assays can be usefully
              combined with functional data to unpick the mechanism of cellular
              decision-making. Finally, we reflect upon the introduction of
              spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, its complementary role
              with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and potential
              application in cellular and gene therapy.",

              hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing
              the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining
              proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
              cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
              angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
              these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the

              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging
              hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of
              energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to
              cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity:
              they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells

              analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and
              validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours,
              respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited
              variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide
              polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations
              (CNAs) were associated with expression in ~40\% of genes, with
              the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By
              delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we
              identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A,
              MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA--RNA

              ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16\% of all
              breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time
              of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum
              of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding
              somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain
              hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA
              sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36\% of
              mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of
              allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for
              the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype,
              the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases
              representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely
              in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the
              basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC.
              Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic
              mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes,
              in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with
              founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and
              motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies,
              suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression.
              Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology
              and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the
              determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.",

  abstract = "Background: Muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) cause
              approximately 150 000 deaths per year worldwide. Survival for
              MIBC patients is heterogeneous, with no clinically validated
              molecular markers that predict clinical outcome. Non-MIBCs
              (NMIBCs) generally have favorable outcome; however, a portion
              progress to MIBC. Hence, development of a prognostic tool that
              can guide decision-making is crucial for improving clinical
              management of bladder urothelial carcinomas. Methods: Tumor grade
              is defined by pathologic evaluation of tumor cell
              differentiation, and it often associates with clinical outcome.
              The current study extrapolates this conventional wisdom and
              combines it with molecular profiling. We developed an 18-gene
              signature that molecularly defines urothelial cellular
              differentiation, thus classifying MIBCs and NMIBCs into two
              subgroups: basal and differentiated. We evaluated the prognostic
              capability of this ``tumor differentiation signature'' and three
              other existing gene signatures including the The Cancer Genome
              Atlas (TCGA; 2707 genes), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA; 2252
              genes/2697 probes), and University of North Carolina at Chapel
              Hill (UNC; 47 genes) using five gene expression data sets derived
              from MIBC and NMIBC patients. All statistical tests were
              two-sided. Results: The tumor differentiation signature
              demonstrated consistency and statistical robustness toward
              stratifying MIBC patients into different overall survival
              outcomes (TCGA cohort 1, P = .03; MDA discovery, P = .009; MDA
              validation, P = .01), while the other signatures were not as
              consistent. In addition, we analyzed the progression (Ta/T1
              progressing to $\geq$T2) probability of NMIBCs. NMIBC patients
              with a basal tumor differentiation signature associated with
              worse progression outcome (P = .008). Gene functional term
              enrichment and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that genes
              involved in the biologic process of immune response and
              inflammatory response are among the most elevated within basal
              bladder cancers, implicating them as candidates for immune
              checkpoint therapies. Conclusions: These results provide
              definitive evidence that a biology-prioritizing clustering
              methodology generates meaningful insights into patient
              stratification and reveals targetable molecular pathways to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bioinformatics tools have been developed to interpret
              gene expression data at the gene set level, and these gene set
              based analyses improve the biologists' capability to discover
              functional relevance of their experiment design. While
              elucidating gene set individually, inter-gene sets association is
              rarely taken into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging
              machine learning technique in computational biology, can be used
              to generate an unbiased combination of gene set, and to determine
              the biological relevance and analysis consistency of these
              combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets.
              RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a gene superset autoencoder
              (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model with the incorporation of
              a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial biological
              features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the
              gene superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights
              trained by the autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer
              is a superset. Trained with genomic data from TCGA and evaluated
              with their accompanying clinical parameters, we showed gene
              supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes and their
              prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological
              relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant
              supersets. CONCLUSIONS: Using autoencoder model and gene superset
              at its latent layer, we demonstrated that gene supersets retain
              sufficient biological information with respect to tumor subtypes
              and clinical prognostic significance. Superset also provides high
              reproducibility on survival analysis and accurate prediction for

  abstract = "The identification of cancer subtypes is vital to advance the
              precision of cancer disease diagnosis and therapy. Several works
              had been done to integrate multiple types of genomics data to
              investigate cancer subtypes. However, (1) few of them
              particularly considered the intrinsic correlations in each type
              of data; (2) to the best of our knowledge, none of them
              considered transcriptome alternative splicing regulation in data
              integration. It has been demonstrated that many cancers are
              related to abnormal alternative splicing regulations in recent
              years. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep learning
              framework, HI-SAE, to integrate gene expression and transcriptome
              alternative splicing profiles data to identify cancer subtypes.
              We adopt the stacked autoencoder (SAE) neural network to learn
              high-level representations in each type of data, respectively,
              and then integrate all the learned high-level representations by
              another learning layer to learn more complex data
              representations. Based on the final learned data representations,
              we cluster patients into different cancer subtype groups.
              Comprehensive experiments based on TCGA breast cancer data
              demonstrate that our model provides an effective and useful
              approach to integrate multiple types of transcriptomics data to
              identify cancer subtypes and the transcriptome alternative

              endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict

              robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in
              six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on
              360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA
              sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an
              alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both
              considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of
              patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e-6) and
              good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More
              aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation
              mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and
              EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt
              signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five
              external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n =

              0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify
              multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of
              patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we

               samples with clinical labels. The ``curse of dimensionality''
               makes it challenging to train a machine learning model using
               high dimensional omics data like DNA methylation and gene
               expression profiles. Here we propose an end-to-end deep learning
               model called OmiVAE to extract low dimensional features and

               achieve task-oriented feature extraction and multi-class
               classification. The training procedure of OmiVAE is comprised of
               an unsupervised phase and a supervised phase. During the
               unsupervised phase, a hierarchical cluster structure of samples
               can be automatically formed without the need for labels. And in
               the supervised phase, OmiVAE achieved an average accuracy of
               97.49\% after 10-fold cross-validation among 33 tumour types and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a
              transformative technology, allowing global transcriptomes of
              individual cells to be profiled with high accuracy. An essential
              task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of cell
              types from complex samples or tissues profiled in an experiment.
              To this end, clustering has become a key computational technique
              for grouping cells based on their transcriptome profiles,
              enabling subsequent cell type identification from each cluster of
              cells. Due to the high feature-dimensionality of the
              transcriptome (i.e. the large number of measured genes in each
              cell) and because only a small fraction of genes are cell
              type-specific and therefore informative for generating cell
              type-specific clusters, clustering directly on the original
              feature/gene dimension may lead to uninformative clusters and
              hinder correct cell type identification. RESULTS: Here, we
              propose an autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework in which
              we first take random subspace projections from the data, then
              compress each random projection to a low-dimensional space using
              an autoencoder artificial neural network, and finally apply
              ensemble clustering across all encoded datasets to generate
              clusters of cells. We employ four evaluation metrics to benchmark
              clustering performance and our experiments demonstrate that the
              proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble can lead to
              substantially improved cell type-specific clusters when applied
              with both the standard k-means clustering algorithm and a
              state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR)
              designed specifically for scRNA-seq data. Compared to directly
              using these clustering algorithms on the original datasets, the
              performance improvement in some cases is up to 100\%, depending
              on the evaluation metric used. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
              that the proposed framework can facilitate more accurate cell
              type identification as well as other downstream analyses. The

              these different approaches to integrate various types of
              multi-omics datasets: iClusterPlus, regularized generalized

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Comprehensive molecular profiling of various cancers
              and other diseases has generated vast amounts of multi-omics
              data. Each type of -omics data corresponds to one feature space,
              such as gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, etc.
              Integrating multi-omics data can link different layers of
              molecular feature spaces and is crucial to elucidate molecular
              pathways underlying various diseases. Machine learning approaches
              to mining multi-omics data hold great promises in uncovering
              intricate relationships among molecular features. However, due to
              the ``big p, small n'' problem (i.e., small sample sizes with
              high-dimensional features), training a large-scale generalizable
              deep learning model with multi-omics data alone is very
              challenging. RESULTS: We developed a method called Multi-view
              Factorization AutoEncoder (MAE) with network constraints that can
              seamlessly integrate multi-omics data and domain knowledge such
              as molecular interaction networks. Our method learns feature and
              patient embeddings simultaneously with deep representation
              learning. Both feature representations and patient
              representations are subject to certain constraints specified as
              regularization terms in the training objective. By incorporating
              domain knowledge into the training objective, we implicitly
              introduced a good inductive bias into the machine learning model,
              which helps improve model generalizability. We performed
              extensive experiments on the TCGA datasets and demonstrated the
              power of integrating multi-omics data and biological interaction
              networks using our proposed method for predicting target clinical

              deep learning on multi-omics data with the ``big p, small n''
              problem, it is helpful to incorporate biological domain knowledge
              into the model as inductive biases. It is very promising to
              design machine learning models that facilitate the seamless

              that can aggregate and filter relevant predictors from
              increasingly complex data inputs. In turn, these models should
              provide deeper insight into which types of data are most relevant
              to improve prognosis. Deep Learning-based neural networks offer a
              potential solution for both problems because they are highly
              flexible and account for data complexity in a non-linear fashion.
              In this study, we implement Deep Learning-based networks to
              determine how gene expression data predicts Cox regression
              survival in breast cancer. We accomplish this through an
              algorithm called SALMON (Survival Analysis Learning with
              Multi-Omics Neural Networks), which aggregates and simplifies
              gene expression data and cancer biomarkers to enable prognosis
              prediction. The results revealed improved performance when more
              omics data were used in model construction. Rather than use raw

              eigengene modules from the result of gene co-expression network

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate

                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

  abstract      = "Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve
                   different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either
                   careful feature engineering, or a significant number of
                   samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally, robots
                   should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any
                   given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of
                   the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering.
                   In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for
                   achieving such capability, which we call one-shot imitation
                   learning. Specifically, we consider the setting where there
                   is a very large set of tasks, and each task has many
                   instantiations. For example, a task could be to stack all
                   blocks on a table into a single tower, another task could be
                   to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers, etc.
                   In each case, different instances of the task would consist
                   of different sets of blocks with different initial states.
                   At training time, our algorithm is presented with pairs of
                   demonstrations for a subset of all tasks. A neural net is
                   trained that takes as input one demonstration and the
                   current state (which initially is the initial state of the
                   other demonstration of the pair), and outputs an action with
                   the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions
                   matches as closely as possible with the second
                   demonstration. At test time, a demonstration of a single
                   instance of a new task is presented, and the neural net is
                   expected to perform well on new instances of this new task.
                   The use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to
                   conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We
                   anticipate that by training this model on a much greater
                   variety of tasks and settings, we will obtain a general
                   system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies
                   that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks. Videos

              estimate the fate of cancer, probabilities of cancer recurrence
              and progression, and to provide survival estimation to the
              patients. The accuracy of cancer prognosis prediction will
              greatly benefit clinical management of cancer patients. The
              improvement of biomedical translational research and the
              application of advanced statistical analysis and machine learning
              methods are the driving forces to improve cancer prognosis

              computational power and rapid advancement in the technology of
              artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning. In
              addition, the cost reduction in large scale next-generation
              sequencing, and the availability of such data through open source
              databases (e.g., TCGA and GEO databases) offer us opportunities
              to possibly build more powerful and accurate models to predict
              cancer prognosis more accurately. In this review, we reviewed the
              most recent published works that used deep learning to build
              models for cancer prognosis prediction. Deep learning has been
              suggested to be a more generic model, requires less data

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Medical practitioners use survival models to explore
              and understand the relationships between patients' covariates
              (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of
              various treatment options. Standard survival models like the
              linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature
              engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment
              interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival
              methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can
              inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have
              yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems.
              METHODS: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep
              neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling
              interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment
              effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment
              recommendations. RESULTS: We perform a number of experiments
              training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We
              demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than
              other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv
              successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a
              patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how
              DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and
              effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv
              can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations.
              Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to
              demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would
              increase the survival time of a set of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
              predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable
              medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in
              their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent advances in kernel-based Deep Learning models
              have introduced a new era in medical research. Originally
              designed for pattern recognition and image processing, Deep
              Learning models are now applied to survival prognosis of cancer
              patients. Specifically, Deep Learning versions of the Cox
              proportional hazards models are trained with transcriptomic data
              to predict survival outcomes in cancer patients. METHODS: In this
              study, a broad analysis was performed on TCGA cancers using a
              variety of Deep Learning-based models, including Cox-nnet,
              DeepSurv, and a method proposed by our group named AECOX
              (AutoEncoder with Cox regression network). Concordance index and
              p-value of the log-rank test are used to evaluate the model
              performances. RESULTS: All models show competitive results across
              12 cancer types. The last hidden layers of the Deep Learning
              approaches are lower dimensional representations of the input
              data that can be used for feature reduction and visualization.
              Furthermore, the prognosis performances reveal a negative
              correlation between model accuracy, overall survival time
              statistics, and tumor mutation burden (TMB), suggesting an
              association among overall survival time, TMB, and prognosis
              prediction accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Deep Learning based algorithms
              demonstrate superior performances than traditional machine
              learning based models. The cancer prognosis results measured in
              concordance index are indistinguishable across models while are
              highly variable across cancers. These findings shedding some
              light into the relationships between patient characteristics and
              survival learnability on a pan-cancer level.",

               obtain multiple types of omics data from a single patient
               sample. Clustering of omics data plays an indispensable role in
               biological and medical research, and it is helpful to reveal
               data structures from multiple collections. Nevertheless,
               clustering of omics data consists of many challenges. The
               primary challenges in omics data analysis come from high
               dimension of data and small size of sample. Therefore, it is
               difficult to find a suitable integration method for structural
               analysis of multiple datasets. In this paper, a multi-view
               clustering based on Stiefel manifold method (MCSM) is proposed.
               The MCSM method comprises three core steps. Firstly, we
               established a binary optimization model for the simultaneous
               clustering problem. Secondly, we solved the optimization problem
               by linear search algorithm based on Stiefel manifold. Finally,
               we integrated the clustering results obtained from three omics
               by using k-nearest neighbor method. We applied this approach to
               four cancer datasets on TCGA. The result shows that our method
               is superior to several state-of-art methods, which depends on
               the hypothesis that the underlying omics cluster class is the
               same. Particularly, our approach has better performance than
               compared approaches when the underlying clusters are
               inconsistent. For patients with different subtypes, both

                   for a neural representation. But what do these statements
                   mean? The reasons to call some neural activity a
                   representation and the assumptions that come with this term
                   are not generally made clear from its common uses in
                   neuroscience. Representation is a central concept in
                   philosophy of mind, with a rich history going back to the
                   ancient period. In order to clarify its usage in
                   neuroscience, here we advance a link between the
                   connotations of this term across these disciplines. We draw
                   on a broad range of discourse in philosophy to distinguish
                   three key aspects of representation: correspondence,
                   functional role, and teleology. We argue that each of these
                   aspects are implied by the explanatory role the term plays
                   in neuroscience. However, evidence related to all three

               adapted to their environment. Does the brain use similar
               brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act
               upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks
               have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic
               weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in
               real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple,
               human-interpretable rules or representations of the world;
               rather, they use local computations to interpolate over
               task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space.
               Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes,
               over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as
               they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse

              mutations that drive cancer development are distributed across a
              large number of genes. This mutational heterogeneity complicates
              efforts to distinguish functional mutations from sporadic,
              passenger mutations. Since cancer mutations are hypothesized to
              target a relatively small number of cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways, a common practice is to assess whether known
              pathways are enriched for mutated genes. We introduce an
              alternative approach that examines mutated genes in the context
              of a genome-scale gene interaction network. We present a
              computationally efficient strategy for de novo identification of
              subnetworks in an interaction network that are mutated in a
              statistically significant number of patients. This framework
              includes two major components. First, we use a diffusion process
              on the interaction network to define a local neighborhood of
              ``influence'' for each mutated gene in the network. Second, we
              derive a two-stage multiple hypothesis test to bound the false
              discovery rate (FDR) associated with the identified subnetworks.
              We test these algorithms on a large human protein-protein
              interaction network using somatic mutation data from glioblastoma
              and lung adenocarcinoma samples. We successfully recover pathways
              that are known to be important in these cancers and also identify
              additional pathways that have been implicated in other cancers

  abstract = "In large collections of tumor samples, it has been observed that
              sets of genes that are commonly involved in the same cancer
              pathways tend not to occur mutated together in the same patient.
              Such gene sets form mutually exclusive patterns of gene
              alterations in cancer genomic data. Computational approaches that
              detect mutually exclusive gene sets, rank and test candidate
              alteration patterns by rewarding the number of samples the
              pattern covers and by punishing its impurity, i.e., additional
              alterations that violate strict mutual exclusivity. However, the
              extant approaches do not account for possible observation errors.
              In practice, false negatives and especially false positives can
              severely bias evaluation and ranking of alteration patterns. To
              address these limitations, we develop a fully probabilistic,
              generative model of mutual exclusivity, explicitly taking
              coverage, impurity, as well as error rates into account, and
              devise efficient algorithms for parameter estimation and pattern
              ranking. Based on this model, we derive a statistical test of
              mutual exclusivity by comparing its likelihood to the null model
              that assumes independent gene alterations. Using extensive
              simulations, the new test is shown to be more powerful than a
              permutation test applied previously. When applied to detect
              mutual exclusivity patterns in glioblastoma and in pan-cancer

              challenge in cancer genomics. Driver mutations generally target
              cellular signaling and regulatory pathways consisting of multiple
              genes. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of
              driver mutations by their recurrence across samples, as different
              combinations of mutations in driver pathways are observed in
              different samples. We introduce the Multi-Dendrix algorithm for
              the simultaneous identification of multiple driver pathways de
              novo in somatic mutation data from a cohort of cancer samples.
              The algorithm relies on two combinatorial properties of mutations

              derive an integer linear program that finds set of mutations

              overlap with known pathways - including Rb, p53, PI(3)K, and cell

  abstract = "Genomic copy number alterations are common in cancer. Finding the
              genes causally implicated in oncogenesis is challenging because
              the gain or loss of a chromosomal region may affect a few key
              driver genes and many passengers. Integrative analyses have
              opened new vistas for addressing this issue. One approach is to
              identify genes with frequent copy number alterations and
              corresponding changes in expression. Several methods also analyse
              effects of transcriptional changes on known pathways. Here, we
              propose a method that analyses in-cis correlated genes for
              evidence of in-trans association to biological processes, with no
              bias towards processes of a particular type or function. The
              method aims to identify cis-regulated genes for which the
              expression correlation to other genes provides further evidence
              of a network-perturbing role in cancer. The proposed unsupervised
              approach involves a sequence of statistical tests to
              systematically narrow down the list of relevant genes, based on
              integrative analysis of copy number and gene expression data. A
              novel adjustment method handles confounding effects of
              co-occurring copy number aberrations, potentially a large source
              of false positives in such studies. Applying the method to
              whole-genome copy number and expression data from 100 primary
              breast carcinomas, 6373 genes were identified as commonly
              aberrant, 578 were highly in-cis correlated, and 56 were in
              addition associated in-trans to biological processes. Among these
              in-trans process associated and cis-correlated (iPAC) genes, 28\%
              have previously been reported as breast cancer associated, and
              64\% as cancer associated. By combining statistical evidence from
              three separate subanalyses that focus respectively on copy
              number, gene expression and the combination of the two, the
              proposed method identifies several known and novel cancer driver
              candidates. Validation in an independent data set supports the
              conclusion that the method identifies genes implicated in cancer.",

  abstract = "A major goal of cancer sequencing projects is to identify genetic
              alterations that determine clinical phenotypes, such as survival
              time or drug response. Somatic mutations in cancer are typically
              very diverse, and are found in different sets of genes in
              different patients. This mutational heterogeneity complicates the
              discovery of associations between individual mutations and a
              clinical phenotype. This mutational heterogeneity is explained in
              part by the fact that driver mutations, the somatic mutations
              that drive cancer development, target genes in cellular pathways,
              and only a subset of pathway genes is mutated in a given patient.
              Thus, pathway-based analysis of associations between mutations
              and phenotype are warranted. Here, we introduce an algorithm to
              find groups of genes, or pathways, whose mutational status is
              associated to a clinical phenotype without prior definition of
              the pathways. Rather, we find subnetworks of genes in an gene
              interaction network with the property that the mutational status
              of the genes in the subnetwork are significantly associated with
              a clinical phenotype. This new algorithm is built upon HotNet, an
              algorithm that finds groups of mutated genes using a heat
              diffusion model and a two-stage statistical test. We focus here
              on discovery of statistically significant correlations between
              mutated subnetworks and patient survival data. A similar approach
              can be used for correlations with other types of clinical data,

              from ovarian cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In the
              TCGA data, we discover nine subnetworks containing genes whose
              mutational status is correlated with survival. Genes in four of
              these subnetworks overlap known pathways, including the focal

              involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed
              by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which
              mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance.
              Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome
              studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively
              significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons
              into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such
              as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein
              titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that
              overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems
              largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel
              analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We
              apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs
              and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and
              spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational
              processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across
              the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
              timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating
              mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to
              eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable

               on expensive meta-learning or are applicable only when labeled

               called FS-NEAT which extends the NEAT neuroevolution method to
               automatically determine an appropriate set of inputs for the
               networks it evolves. By learning the network's inputs, topology,

               selection problem without relying on meta-learning or labeled

               demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than
               regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller

              Neuroevolution, a machine learning field that combines neural
              networks and evolutionary computation, provides aid in this
              challenge by simultaneously classifying microarray data and
              selecting the subset of more relevant genes. The main algorithm,
              FS-NEAT, was adapted by the addition of new structural operators
              designed for this high dimensional data. In addition, a rigorous
              filtering and preprocessing protocol was employed to select
              quality microarray datasets for the proposed method, selecting 13
              datasets from three different cancer types. The results show that
              Neuroevolution was able to successfully classify microarray

              also finding subsets of genes that can be generalized for other

              genome-wide measurements of somatic mutations in large numbers of
              cancer patients. A major challenge in the interpretation of these
              data is to distinguish functional ``driver mutations'' important
              for cancer development from random ``passenger mutations.'' A
              common approach for identifying driver mutations is to find genes
              that are mutated at significant frequency in a large cohort of
              cancer genomes. This approach is confounded by the observation
              that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways. Thus, each cancer patient may exhibit a
              different combination of mutations that are sufficient to perturb
              these pathways. This mutational heterogeneity presents a problem
              for predicting driver mutations solely from their frequency of
              occurrence. We introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage
              and exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of
              genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with
              passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix, to
              find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We apply
              Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes in 188
              lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84 glioblastoma
              patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000 patients with various
              cancers. In all data sets, we find groups of genes that are
              mutated in large subsets of patients and whose mutations are
              approximately exclusive. Our Dendrix algorithms scale to
              whole-genome analysis of thousands of patients and thus will

              interest. Such tools are frequently used in gene-centric
              approaches derived from RNA-sequencing or microarrays such as
              Ingenuity or GSEA, but they have also been adapted for
              interval-based analysis derived from DNA methylation or
              ChIP/ATAC-sequencing. Gene-set analysis tools return, as a
              result, a list of significant gene-sets. However, while these
              results are useful for the researcher in the identification of
              major biological insights, they may be complex to interpret
              because many gene-sets have largely overlapping gene contents.
              Additionally, in many cases the result of gene-set analysis
              consists of a large number of gene-sets making it complicated to
              identify the major biological insights. RESULTS: We present
              GeneSetCluster, a novel approach which allows clustering of
              identified gene-sets, from one or multiple experiments and/or
              tools, based on shared genes. GeneSetCluster calculates a
              distance score based on overlapping gene content, which is then
              used to cluster them together and as a result, GeneSetCluster
              identifies groups of gene-sets with similar gene-set definitions

              affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient.
              While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer
              genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is
              incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have
              developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer
              (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical
              tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member
              genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2)
              member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the
              same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the
              modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer

              altered modules in glioblastoma (GBM) and highlights the striking
              mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and
              Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel
              observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually
              exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of RB1,
              suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in
              this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene
              involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any

              projects, such as the TCGA GBM project, is the ability to
              distinguish cancer-causing ``driver'' mutations from passively
              selected ``passenger'' mutations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In contrast
              to a purely frequency based approach to identifying driver
              mutations in cancer, we propose an automated network-based
              approach for identifying candidate oncogenic processes and driver
              genes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular
              networks contain functional modules, and that tumors target
              specific modules critical to their growth. Key elements in the
              approach include combined analysis of sequence mutations and DNA
              copy number alterations; use of a unified molecular interaction
              network consisting of both protein-protein interactions and
              signaling pathways; and identification and statistical assessment
              of network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of interest
              with a higher density of interactions within groups than between
              groups. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm and extend the observation that
              GBM alterations tend to occur within specific functional modules,
              in spite of considerable patient-to-patient variation, and that
              two of the largest modules involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K
              and receptor protein kinases. We also identify new candidate
              drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative oncogene and
              an activator of the PI3K pathway; and, three additional
              significantly altered modules, including one involved in
              microtubule organization. To facilitate the application of our
              network-based approach to additional cancer types, we make the
              method freely available as part of a software tool called NetBox.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The first step for clinical diagnostics, prognostics
              and targeted therapeutics of cancer is to comprehensively
              understand its molecular mechanisms. Large-scale cancer genomics
              projects are providing a large volume of data about genomic,
              epigenomic and gene expression aberrations in multiple cancer
              types. One of the remaining challenges is to identify driver
              mutations, driver genes and driver pathways promoting cancer
              proliferation and filter out the unfunctional and passenger ones.
              RESULTS: In this study, we propose two methods to solve the
              so-called maximum weight submatrix problem, which is designed to
              de novo identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in
              cancer. The first one is an exact method that can be helpful for
              assessing other approximate or/and heuristic algorithms. The
              second one is a stochastic and flexible method that can be
              employed to incorporate other types of information to improve the
              first method. Particularly, we propose an integrative model to
              combine mutation and expression data. We first apply our methods
              onto simulated data to show their efficiency. We further apply
              the proposed methods onto several real biological datasets, such
              as the mutation profiles of 74 head and neck squamous cell
              carcinomas samples, 90 glioblastoma tumor samples and 313 ovarian
              carcinoma samples. The gene expression profiles were also
              considered for the later two data. The results show that our
              integrative model can identify more biologically relevant gene
              sets. We have implemented all these methods and made a package
              called mutated driver pathway finder, which can be easily used
              for other researchers. AVAILABILITY: A MATLAB package of

  abstract = "Pathway or gene set over-representation analysis (ORA) has become
              a routine task in functional genomics studies. However, currently
              widely used ORA tools employ statistical methods such as Fisher's
              exact test that reduce a pathway into a list of genes, ignoring
              the constitutive functional non-equivalent roles of genes and the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A signal transduction pathway (STP) is a network of
               intercellular information flow initiated when extracellular
               signaling molecules bind to cell-surface receptors. Many
               aberrant STPs have been associated with various cancers. To
               develop optimal treatments for cancer patients, it is important
               to discover which STPs are implicated in a cancer or
               cancer-subtype. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) makes available
               gene expression level data on cases and controls in ten
               different types of cancer including breast cancer, colon
               adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, kidney renal papillary cell
               carcinoma, low grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous
               cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and
               uterine corpus endometriod carcinoma. Signaling Pathway Impact
               Analysis (SPIA) is a software package that analyzes gene
               expression data to identify whether a pathway is relevant in a
               given condition. METHODS: We present the results of a study that
               uses SPIA to investigate all 157 signaling pathways in the KEGG
               PATHWAY database. We analyzed each of the ten cancer types
               mentioned above separately, and we perform a pan-cancer analysis
               by grouping the data for all the cancer types. RESULTS: In each
               analysis several pathways were found to be markedly more
               significant than all the other pathways. We call them notable.
               Research has already established a connection between many of
               these pathways and the corresponding cancer type. However, some
               of our discovered pathways appear to be new findings. Altogether
               there were 37 notable findings in the separate analyses, 26 of
               them occurred in 7 pathways. These 7 pathways included the 4
               notable pathways discovered in the pan-cancer analysis. So, our
               results suggest that these 7 pathways account for much of the
               mechanisms of cancer. Furthermore, by looking at the overlap
               among pathways, we identified possible regions on the pathways
               where the aberrant activity is occurring. CONCLUSIONS: We
               obtained 37 notable findings concerning 18 pathways. Some of
               them appear to be new discoveries. Furthermore, we identified
               regions on pathways where the aberrant activity might be
               occurring. We conclude that our results will prove to be
               valuable to cancer researchers because they provide many

              However, few methods consider the functional non-equal roles of
              genes in pathways and the complex gene-gene interactions in a
              network. RESULTS: We present a novel method in pan-cancer
              analysis that identifies de-regulated genes with a functional
              role by integrating pathway and network data. A pan-cancer
              analysis of 7158 tumour/normal samples from 16 cancer types

              driver genes with at least 2/15 tools. Finally, we applied a

              The increasing availability of tumor data allows to research the

              large available repositories of high dimensional tumor samples
              characterised with germline and somatic mutation data requires
              advance computational modelling for data interpretation. In this
              work, we propose to analyze this complex data with neural network
              learning, a methodology that made impressive advances in image
              and natural language processing. RESULTS: Here we present a tumor
              mutation profile analysis pipeline based on an autoencoder model,
              which is used to discover better representations of lower

               a critical problem in the modern genomics era. Assays such as
               single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) offer an opportunity to
               interrogate cellular level epigenetic heterogeneity through
               patterns of variability in open chromatin. However, these assays
               exhibit technical variability that complicates clear
               classification and cell type identification in heterogeneous
               populations. We present scABC, an R package for the unsupervised

               scATAC-seq data and discover regions of open chromatin specific

               cellular level epigenetic heterogeneity but its application in

  abstract = "High-throughput single-cell gene expression profiling has enabled
              the definition of new cell types and developmental trajectories.
              Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological
              interpretation, and a popular method is t-stochastic neighbor
              embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns well but
              distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We
              developed similarity weighted nonnegative embedding (SWNE), which
              enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and
              factors that separate cell states on the visualization alongside
              the cells and maintains fidelity when visualizing local and
              global structure for both developmental trajectories and discrete
              cell types. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to
              decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant
              factors; embeds the cells, genes, and factors in a 2D
              visualization; and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the
              embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single-cell RNA-seq data from
              hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells. SWNE is

              for biological brains. This approach has the potential to
              radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems,

              seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to

               reinforcement signal. The efficacy of the algorithm is verified

               the lane detection, the paper introduces the spiking neural
               network with the parallel mechanism to detect the lane. Firstly,
               the region of interests (ROI) is set on the origin image that
               collected by a vehicle on-board camera. In order to reduce
               processing time, areas outside the road are excluded in the ROI.

               RGB to grayscale, gray stretch and median filtering to eliminate
               noise. Edge detection of the lane is the key to determine

  abstract = "Understanding how recurrent neural circuits can learn to
              implement dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in
              neuroscience. The credit assignment problem, i.e. determining the
              local contribution of each synapse to the network's global output
              error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically plausible
              local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks
              implementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of
              number of neurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from
              rate models. Finally, these networks should be robust to noise
              and neural deaths in order to sustain these representations in
              the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We approach
              this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking
              networks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control theory. Local
              learning rules are ensured by feeding back into the network its
              own error, resulting in a synaptic plasticity rule depending
              solely on presynaptic inputs and post-synaptic feedback. The
              spiking efficiency and robustness of the network are guaranteed
              by maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory balance, ensuring
              that each spike represents a local projection of the global
              output error and minimizes a loss function. The resulting
              networks can learn to implement complex dynamics with very small

              on the traditional CMOS technology, the efficiency of SNN systems
              is also unsatisfactory. In this work, we explore different
              training algorithms of SNN for real-world applications, and
              demonstrate that the Neural Sampling method is much more
              effective than Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and

              and trained it to perform a simple movement task, which consisted
              of rotating a single-joint ``forearm'' to a target. Learning was
              based on a reinforcement mechanism analogous to that of the
              dopamine system. This provided a global reward or punishment
              signal in response to decreasing or increasing distance from hand
              to target, respectively. Output was partially driven by Poisson
              motor babbling, creating stochastic movements that could then be
              shaped by learning. The virtual forearm consisted of a single
              segment rotated around an elbow joint, controlled by flexor and
              extensor muscles. The model consisted of 144 excitatory and 64
              inhibitory event-based neurons, each with AMPA, NMDA, and GABA
              synapses. Proprioceptive cell input to this model encoded the 2
              muscle lengths. Plasticity was only enabled in feedforward
              connections between input and output excitatory units, using
              spike-timing-dependent eligibility traces for synaptic credit or
              blame assignment. Learning resulted from a global 3-valued
              signal: reward (+1), no learning (0), or punishment (-1),
              corresponding to phasic increases, lack of change, or phasic
              decreases of dopaminergic cell firing, respectively. Successful
              learning only occurred when both reward and punishment were
              enabled. In this case, 5 target angles were learned successfully
              within 180 s of simulation time, with a median error of 8
              degrees. Motor babbling allowed exploratory learning, but
              decreased the stability of the learned behavior, since the hand
              continued moving after reaching the target. Our model
              demonstrated that a global reinforcement signal, coupled with
              eligibility traces for synaptic plasticity, can train a spiking

              modulate lease neurotransmitter, or it may fail to release
              (Stevens, the membrane conductances of their postsynaptic
              tar-1993). At first glance, such unreliability may seem sur-gets.
              Second, the efficacy of synaptic transmission var-ies dynamically

              1064 The learning rules studied in this paper are compatible with
              both of these features of biological synapses. By its nature, the
              present work is speculative. The particular form of plasticity
              hypothesized here may turn out to exist in the brain. Even if it
              does not, the general concept of biological synapses that rely on
              microscopic randomness for the purposes of optimization could
              still be correct. One can imagine many possible realizations of
              the concept, of which the hedonistic synapse is just one. The
              wider goal of this paper is to stimulate theorists to imagine
              these possibilities and experimentalists to search for them.

  abstract = "We propose a new interpretation of spiking neurons as Bayesian
              integra-tors accumulating evidence over time about events in the
              external world or the body, and communicating to other neurons
              their certainties about these events. In this model, spikes
              signal the occurrence of new infor-mation, i.e. what cannot be
              predicted from the past activity. As a result, firing statistics
              are close to Poisson, albeit providing a deterministic
              rep-resentation of probabilities. We proceed to develop a theory
              of Bayesian inference in spiking neural networks, recurrent
              interactions implement-ing a variant of belief propagation. Many
              perceptual and motor tasks performed by the central nervous
              system are probabilis-tic, and can be described in a Bayesian
              framework [4, 3]. A few important but hidden properties, such as
              direction of motion, or appropriate motor commands, are inferred
              from many noisy, local and ambiguous sensory cues. These
              evidences are combined with priors about the sensory world and
              body. Importantly, because most of these inferences should lead
              to quick and irreversible decisions in a perpetually changing
              world, noisy cues have to be integrated on-line, but in a way
              that takes into account unpredictable events, such as a sudden
              change in motion direction or the appearance of a new stimulus.",

              conductance-based synapses. The neuron characteristics are
              derived from our earlier detailed models of the different
              cerebellar neurons. We tested the cerebellum model in a real-time
              control application with a robotic platform. Delays were
              introduced in the different sensorimotor pathways according to
              the biological system. The main plasticity in the cerebellar

@ARTICLE{Fuster_undated-qq,
  title    = "Upper processing stages of the perception -- action cycle",
  author   = "Fuster, Joaqu{\'\i}n M",
  abstract = "The neural substrate for behavioral, cognitive and linguistic
              actions is hierarchically organized in the cor-tex of the frontal
              lobe. In their methodologically impec-cable study, Koechlin et
              al. reveal the neural dynamics of the frontal hierarchy in
              behavioral action. Progress-ively higher areas control the
              performance of actions requiring the integration of progressively
              more complex and temporally dispersed information. The study
              sub-stantiates the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in the
              temporal organization of behavior. In 1874, the Russian
              neuroanatomist W. Betz [1] was the first to note a major
              functional dichotomy of structures along the nerve axis.
              Posterior structures are largely devoted to sensory functions,
              anterior structures to motor functions. This division of labor is
              most obvious in the spinal cord. We can also discern it in the
              cerebral cortex, however, if we expand sensory functions to
              include representations acquired through the senses and motor
              functions to include executive representations. A wealth of
              physiological and neuropsychological evidence points to a
              hierarchy of executive areas in the lateral cortex of the frontal
              lobe [2]. The primary motor and premotor areas constitute the
              lowest levels of that hierarchy. Above them in the hierarchy lie
              a series of progressively higher, anatomically more anterior
              areas of association cortex that are designated 'prefrontal'.
              Using fMRI on human subjects performing visuomotor tasks,
              Koechlin et al. [3] expose for the first time the cascading
              neurodynamics of the executive frontal hierarchy in motor action.
              Motor processing and control proceed from anterior prefrontal,
              through caudal prefrontal, to premotor cortex. At each level, the
              processing is informed by the processing at higher levels and by
              controlling sensory information which, as it moves down the
              hierarchy, is progressively simpler, more demanding of immediate
              action and less of temporal integration. The tasks of Koechlin et
              al. consisted of sequences of manual reactions to visual stimuli
              of varying complexity. The reaction to each stimulus depended on
              its visual features (e.g. color with or without a pattern
              'context') and an instructional cue that preceded the sequence to
              which that stimulus belonged. All motor reactions and the
              significance of each instructional cue were part of a set of
              rules that the subject had learned before the experi-ment. The
              key measurement was the degree of activation in anterior
              (rostral) and posterior (caudal) prefrontal cortex, and in
              premotor cortex. The authors used a computational model based on
              Shannon's information theory [4] and a hierarchical model of
              frontal organization and processing [2]. By factor analysis of
              the fMRI data, they determined that rostral prefrontal cortex
              controls behavior mainly in accordance with the instructional cue
              ('temporal episode'), caudal prefrontal cortex with the context
              of the stimulus, and premotor cortex with the stimulus itself.",

  abstract = "Animals repeat rewarded behaviors, but the physiological basis of
              reward-based learning has only been partially elucidated. On one
              hand, experimental evidence shows that the neuromodulator
              dopamine carries information about rewards and affects synaptic
              plasticity. On the other hand, the theory of reinforcement
              learning provides a framework for reward-based learning. Recent
              models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity have
              made first steps towards bridging the gap between the two
              approaches, but faced two problems. First, reinforcement learning
              is typically formulated in a discrete framework, ill-adapted to
              the description of natural situations. Second, biologically
              plausible models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent
              plasticity require precise calculation of the reward prediction
              error, yet it remains to be shown how this can be computed by
              neurons. Here we propose a solution to these problems by
              extending the continuous temporal difference (TD) learning of
              Doya (2000) to the case of spiking neurons in an actor-critic
              network operating in continuous time, and with continuous state
              and action representations. In our model, the critic learns to
              predict expected future rewards in real time. Its activity,
              together with actual rewards, conditions the delivery of a
              neuromodulatory TD signal to itself and to the actor, which is
              responsible for action choice. In simulations, we show that such
              an architecture can solve a Morris water-maze-like navigation
              task, in a number of trials consistent with reported animal
              performance. We also use our model to solve the acrobot and the
              cartpole problems, two complex motor control tasks. Our model
              provides a plausible way of computing reward prediction error in
              the brain. Moreover, the analytically derived learning rule is

              function with respect to the synaptic strengths. For a biological
              neural network, such a gradient computation would be difficult to
              implement, because of the complex dynamics of intrinsic and
              synaptic conductances in neurons. Here we show that irregular
              spiking similar to that observed in biological neurons could be
              used as the basis for a learning rule that calculates a
              stochastic approximation to the gradient. The learning rule is
              derived based on a special class of model networks in which
              neurons fire spike trains with Poisson statistics. The learning
              is compatible with forms of synaptic dynamics such as short-term
              facilitation and depression. By correlating the fluctuations in

  abstract = "Background: In the development of Brain Machine Interfaces
              (BMIs), there is a great need to enable users to interact with
              changing environments during the activities of daily life. It is
              expected that the number and scope of the learning tasks
              encountered during interaction with the environment as well as
              the pattern of brain activity will vary over time. These
              conditions, in addition to neural reorganization, pose a
              challenge to decoding neural commands for BMIs. We have developed
              a new BMI framework in which a computational agent symbiotically
              decoded users' intended actions by utilizing both motor commands
              and goal information directly from the brain through a continuous
              Perception-Action-Reward Cycle (PARC). Methodology: The control
              architecture designed was based on Actor-Critic learning, which
              is a PARC-based reinforcement learning method. Our
              neurophysiology studies in rat models suggested that Nucleus
              Accumbens (NAcc) contained a rich representation of goal
              information in terms of predicting the probability of earning
              reward and it could be translated into an evaluative feedback for
              adaptation of the decoder with high precision. Simulated neural
              control experiments showed that the system was able to maintain
              high performance in decoding neural motor commands during novel
              tasks or in the presence of reorganization in the neural input.
              We then implanted a dual micro-wire array in the primary motor
              cortex (M1) and the NAcc of rat brain and implemented a full
              closed-loop system in which robot actions were decoded from the
              single unit activity in M1 based on an evaluative feedback that
              was estimated from NAcc. Conclusions: Our results suggest that
              adapting the BMI decoder with an evaluative feedback that is
              directly extracted from the brain is a possible solution to the
              problem of operating BMIs in changing environments with dynamic
              neural signals. During closed-loop control, the agent was able to
              solve a reaching task by capturing the action and reward

              simple tasks. The size of the replay buffer is actually a

              of experience replay leads to the formulation of the Combined DQN

               nervous system of the leech",
  author    = "Nicholls, J G and Purves, D",
  abstract  = "In leech ganglia, three sensory cells of different modality
               converge on a motoneurone, where they form chemical and
               electrical synapses. Each of these synapses behaves in a
               characteristic manner and the nature of the transmission
               mechanism has significant functional consequences for the
               operation of the reflexes. An analysis has been made of the
               effects of trains of impulses on synaptic transmission through
               these pathways, using frequencies that correspond to natural
               firing.1. At the chemical synapse between the nociceptive
               sensory cell and the motoneurone, two opposing events occur:
               facilitation and depression. Thus, with trains of impulses, the
               synaptic potentials first increase in amplitude and then
               decrease. The two processes could be separated by altering the
               Mg and Ca content of the bathing fluid. In concentrations of Mg
               that reduced the amplitude of a single control chemical synaptic
               potential, pure facilitation occurred during a train. Depression
               predominated during brief trains in raised concentrations of Ca,
               although synaptic potentials were initially larger. These
               results suggest that changes in the amount of transmitter
               released by each presynaptic action potential can account for
               the changes observed in chemical synaptic transmission.2. In
               contrast, electrical transmission between the sensory cell
               responding to touch and the same motoneurone did not show
               facilitation or depression. The electrical coupling potential in
               the motoneurone was relatively constant when the touch cell
               fired at high or low frequencies in normal Ringer fluid, high
               Mg, or high Ca fluid.3. Further differences between chemical and
               electrical synapses were apparent when the preparation was
               cooled to 4 degrees C. In the cold the latency of chemically
               evoked synaptic potentials in the motoneurone increased and
               their amplitude declined drastically with repetitive
               stimulation, while electrical coupling potentials were
               unaffected.4. A brief hyperpolarization of the presynaptic cell
               by injected current produced a marked and prolonged increase in
               chemically evoked synaptic potentials, but did not influence
               electrical synaptic transmission.5. The synapses of the sensory
               cell responding to pressure, which are both chemical and
               electrical, behaved as expected: the chemical synaptic
               potentials showed facilitation and depression while electrical
               transmission remained relatively constant.6. These experiments
               emphasize the different functional consequences of electrical or
               chemical synapses in reflex pathways for the transmission of
               signals that arise as a result of natural sensory stimuli.",

  author   = "Schultz, Wolfram",
  abstract = "The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical
              self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain
              dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information
              and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic
              activations after primary liquid and food rewards and
              conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They
              show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that
              resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly
              salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive
              stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with
              appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting
              and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between
              different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting
              message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
              responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on
              event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding
              events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by
              events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events
              that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to
              a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal
              characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement
              learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning
              from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may
              contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde
              action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement
              learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine
              onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global
              reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may
              improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information
              before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by
              modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is
              supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex,
              and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do
              not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation
              between the different reward signals may assure the use of
              specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the
              other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly
              serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code
              rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors
              in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive
              events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following
              dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a
              defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general
              enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus
              dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission
              of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic
              neurons.",

              responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there
              when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are
              active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how
              the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking
              neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated
              by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident
              firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of
              subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the
              extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a
              few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the
              reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive
              to the ongoing activity-the key feature that distinguishes our
              approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly
              assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or
              that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This
              study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in
              brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement
              signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence
              the right synapses at the right time.",

               computing in the brain and recent advances in neurosciences,
               they derive their strength and interest from an accurate
               modeling of synaptic interactions between neurons, taking into
               account the time of spike firing. SNNs overcome the
               computational power of neural networks made of threshold or
               sigmoidal units. Based on dynamic event-driven processing, they
               open up new horizons for developing models with an exponential
               capacity to memorize and a strong ability to do fast adaptation.
               Today, the main challenge is to discover efficient learning
               rules that might take advantage of the specific features of SNNs
               while keeping the nice properties (general-purpose, easy-to-use,

              of static neurons that produce analog output, despite the fact
              that information processing in the brain is predominantly carried
              out by dynamic neurons that produce discrete pulses called
              spikes. Research in spike-based computation has been impeded by
              the lack of efficient supervised learning algorithm for spiking

              optimizing spiking network models by introducing a differentiable
              formulation of spiking networks and deriving the exact gradient
              calculation. For demonstration, we trained recurrent spiking
              networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing fast
              (~millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of
              information, and a delayed memory XOR task over extended duration
              (~second). The results show that our method indeed optimizes the
              spiking network dynamics on the time scale of individual spikes
              as well as behavioral time scales. In conclusion, our result
              offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm for

              autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a
              large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the

              of the issues associated with reinforcement learning, such as the
              distal reward problem. Spiking neural networks provide a useful
              technique in implementing reinforcement learning in an embodied
              context as they can deal with continuous parameter spaces and as
              such are better at generalizing the correct behaviour to perform
              in a given context. In this project we implement a version of
              DA-modulated STDP in an embodied robot on a food foraging task.
              Through simulated dopaminergic neurons we show how the robot is
              able to learn a sequence of behaviours in order to achieve a food
              reward. In tests the robot was able to learn food-attraction
              behaviour, and subsequently unlearn this behaviour when the
              environment changed, in all 50 trials. Moreover we show that the
              robot is able to operate in an environment whereby the optimal
              behaviour changes rapidly and so the agent must constantly
              relearn. In a more complex environment, consisting of
              food-containers, the robot was able to learn food-container
              attraction in 95\% of trials, despite the large temporal distance
              between the correct behaviour and the reward. This is achieved by
              shifting the dopamine response from the primary stimulus (food)
              to the secondary stimulus (food-container). Our work provides
              insights into the reasons behind some observed biological

              improved data availability. This paper explores domain
              randomization, a simple technique for training models on
              simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing
              rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the

              a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find
              that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is
              accurate to $1.5$cm and robust to distractors and partial
              occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic

              tasks where en-vironment rewards are particularly sparse. One
              successful method of guiding exploration in these domains is to
              imitate trajectories provided by a human demon-strator. However,
              these demonstrations are typically collected under artificial
              conditions, i.e. with access to the agent's exact environment
              setup and the demon-strator's action and reward trajectories.
              Here we propose a two-stage method that overcomes these
              limitations by relying on noisy, unaligned footage without access
              to such data. First, we learn to map unaligned videos from

              objectives constructed over both time and modality (i.e. vision
              and sound). Second, we embed a single YouTube video in this
              representation to construct a reward function that encourages an
              agent to imitate human gameplay. This method of one-shot
              imitation allows our agent to convincingly exceed human-level

              fundamentals of DNN-based autonomous driving systems, they may
              exhibit erroneous behaviors and cause fatal accidents. To resolve
              the safety issues of autonomous driving systems, a recent set of
              testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate
              test cases, e.g., new input images transformed from the original
              ones. Unfortunately, many such generated input images often
              render inferior authenticity, lacking accurate semantic
              information of the driving scenes and hence compromising the
              resulting efficacy and reliability. In this paper, we propose
              DeepRoad, an unsupervised framework to automatically generate
              large amounts of accurate driving scenes to test the consistency
              of DNN-based autonomous driving systems across different scenes.
              In particular, DeepRoad delivers driving scenes with various
              weather conditions (including those with rather extreme
              conditions) by applying the Generative Adversarial Networks
              (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes.
              Moreover, we have implemented DeepRoad to test three
              well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems.
              Experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect
              thousands of behavioral inconsistencies in these systems.",

  abstract = "In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of
              machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this
              approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is
              trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation.
              Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the
              resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes
              outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a
              single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological
              neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information,
              and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter.
              Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically
              realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if
              one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal
              description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in
              time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible
              local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power,
              neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs
              remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is
              usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation.
              Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to
              train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and
              computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag
              behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and
              can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many
              fewer operations and are the better candidates to process
              spatio-temporal data.",

              might be representations of objects. The temporal continuity
              typical of objects has been used in an associative learning rule
              with a short-term memory trace to help build invariant object
              representations. In this paper, we show that spatial continuity
              can also provide a basis for helping a system to self-organize
              invariant representations. We introduce a new learning paradigm
              ``continuous transformation learning'' which operates by mapping
              spatially similar input patterns to the same postsynaptic neurons
              in a competitive learning system. As the inputs move through the
              space of possible continuous transforms (e.g. translation,
              rotation, etc.), the active synapses are modified onto the set of
              postsynaptic neurons. Because other transforms of the same

              of postsynaptic neurons is activated by the new transforms, and
              learning of the new active inputs onto the same postsynaptic

              Between-part relations can be characterized by specifying the

              process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions
              of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric
              components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges, and cones. The
              fundamental assumption of the proposed theory,
              recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of
              generalized-cone components, called geons (N $\leq$ 36), can be
              derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of
              edges in a two-dimensional image: curvature, collinearity,
              symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these
              properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image
              quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the
              image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC
              thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided
              relation between the classic principles of perceptual
              organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward
              regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object
              but the object's components. Representational power derives from
              an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of
              Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of
              object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can
              be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized
              even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or

              action potentials. More recent proposals that information may be
              carried by precise spike timing have been challenged by the
              assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy fashion -
              presumably reflecting fluctuations in synaptic input and, thus,
              incapable of transmitting signals with millisecond fidelity. Here
              we show that precisely synchronized action potentials can
              propagate within a model of cortical network activity that
              recapitulates many of the features of biological systems. An
              attractor, yielding a stable spiking precision in the
              (sub)millisecond range, governs the dynamics of synchronization.
              Our results indicate that a combinatorial neural code, based on
              rapid associations of groups of neurons co-ordinating their
              activity at the single spike level, is possible within a
              cortical-like network.",

              79: 2857--2874, 1998. The study was designed to reveal
              occurrences of precise firing sequences (PFSs) in cortical
              activity and to test their behavioral relevance. Two monkeys were
              trained to perform a delayed-response paradigm and to open puzzle
              boxes. Extracellular activity was recorded from neurons in
              premotor and prefrontal areas with an array of six
              microelectrodes. An algorithm was developed to detect PFSs,
              defined as a set of three spikes and two intervals with a
              precision of $\pm$1 ms repeating significantly more than expected
              by chance. The expected level of repetition was computed based on
              the firing rate and the pairwise correlation of the participating
              units, assuming a Poisson distribution of event counts.
              Accordingly, the search for PFSs was corrected for rate
              modulations. PFSs were found in 24/25 recording sessions. Most
              PFSs (76\%) were composed of spikes of more than one unit but
              usually not more than two units (67\%). The PFSs spanned hundreds
              of milliseconds, and the average interval between two events
              within the PFSs was 200 ms. No traces of periodic oscillations
              were found in the PFS intervals. The bins of the matrix that were
              defined as PFSs were isolated temporally: the spikes that
              generated PFSs were not associated with high-frequency bursts or
              rapid coherent rate fluctuations. A given PFS tended to be
              correlated with the animal's behavior. Furthermore, for 19\% of
              the PFS pairs that shared the same unit composition, each member
              of the pair was associated with a different type of behavior. The
              PFSs often appeared in clusters that were associated with
              particular phases of the behavior. The firing rate of single
              units did not provide a full explanation for the timing and
              structure of these clusters. A reduced spike train (RST) was
              defined for each unit by taking all spikes of that unit that were
              part of any PFS. In 88\% of the cases the degree of modulation of
              the RST was higher than that of the complete spike train. The
              results suggest that relevant information is carried by the fine
              temporal structure of cortical activity. A coding scheme that
              involves such temporal structures is rich and sufficiently
              flexible to facilitate a rapid organization of cortical neurons
              into functional groups. The results can be accounted for by the
              synfire chain model, which suggests that cortical activity is
              mediated by synchronous activation of neural groups in a
              reverberatory mode.",

  abstract = "Abstract Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is the third generation of
              Artificial Neural Networks, the paradigm which fuels the current
              progress made in Artificial Intelligence. Compared to the earlier
              generations of Neural Networks, SNNs are a biologically accurate
              framework, which embodies the time characteristics of the nerve
              cells. These consider the arrival time of the presynaptic action
              potential to the postsynaptic neurone, based on which the
              synapses are weakened or strengthened, process known as
              Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). However, there has been
              little research on applying SNNs to real- life applications, and
              in this project, these artificial networks are applied to
              autonomous vehicles problem. Here we propose a system that uses a
              real-physics engine, AirSim, to simulate a car that is controlled
              by an SNN using STDP. The system uses two separate SNNs, designed
              to emulate the sensory-motor coupling and to control the steering
              and throttle of the vehicle. A circuit track was created for
              testing the system containing two types of challenges, ramps and
              road turns, for which was found that the car can drive a ramp,
              but steering in a road tun was proven to be challenging.
              Throughout these tests, the project illustrates the importance of
              using the appropriate encoding for an SNN, and the results
              suggest the potential applications of a biologically accurate
              framework for autonomous vehicles. The software designed is
              versatile, and with minor modifications, it can be applied to
              other problems. We believe that this project enhances the number
              of areas to which SNN can be utilised and lays the path for
              further research and development in using the third generation of
              Artificial Neural Networks to self-driving cars.",

               controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial
               example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals

               demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN
               with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our
               black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to
               chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local
               model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs
               synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the
               target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial

              to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample of
              input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is
              intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify
              it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a
              human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet
              the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose
              security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack
              on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access
              to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work have
              assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data
              directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always
              the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example
              those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as

              Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large
              datasets and minimization of I/O costs. This paper presents a
              data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing
              and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is
              especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally
              and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data
              points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the
              available resources (i.e., available memory and time
              constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a
              single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a
              few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering
              algorithm proposed in the database area to handle ``noise'' (data
              points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.
              We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order
              sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments.

              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ($\geq$ 25) to implement. Because the majority of

              should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the
              signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by
              Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta
              becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per
              unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the
              probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In
              this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of
              quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that
              the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
              finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization
              criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a
              minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into
              the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

              to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the

              can be trained efficiently, in a supervised manner, using
              backpropagation through time. Indeed, the most commonly used
              spiking neuron model, the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, obeys
              a differential equation which can be approximated using discrete
              time steps, leading to a recurrent relation for the potential.
              The firing threshold causes optimization issues, but they can be
              overcome using a surrogate gradient. Here, we extend previous
              approaches in two ways. Firstly, we show that the approach can be
              used to train convolutional layers. Convolutions can be done in
              space, time (which simulates conduction delays), or both.
              Secondly, we include fast horizontal connections \textbackslash`a

               evolving an obstacle avoiding robot controller. The technique is
               used to rapidly evolve controllers that work in a complex

  abstract  = "Parallel accelerators, such as GPUs, are a key enabler of
               large-scale Machine Learning (ML) applications. However,
               programmers often lack detailed knowledge of the underlying
               architecture and fail to fully leverage their computational
               power. This paper proposes GEVO-ML, a tool for automatically
               discovering optimization opportunities and tuning the
               performance of ML kernels. GEVO-ML extends earlier work on GEVO
               (Gpu optimization using EVOlutionary computation) by focusing
               directly on ML frameworks, intermediate languages, and target
               architectures. It retains the multi-objective evolutionary
               search developed for GEVO, which searches for edits to GPU code
               compiled to LLVM-IR and improves performance on desired criteria
               while retaining required functionality. In earlier work, we
               studied some ML workloads in GPU settings and found that GEVO
               could improve kernel speeds by factors ranging from 1.7X to
               2.9X, even with access to only a small portion of the overall ML
               framework. This workshop paper examines the limitations and
               constraints of GEVO for ML workloads and discusses our GEVO-ML

              majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here
              banishes determinants to the end of the book and focuses on the
              central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of
              linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual
              care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example,
              the book presents-without having defined determinants-a clean
              proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex
              vector space (or an odd-dimensional real vector space) has an
              eigenvalue. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter
              helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear
              algebra. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand
              for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus, the text starts by
              discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and
              dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the
              first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the
              finite-dimensional spectral theorem. This second edition includes
              a new section on orthogonal projections and minimization
              problems. The sections on self-adjoint operators, normal
              operators, and the spectral theorem have been rewritten. New
              examples and new exercises have been added, several proofs have

  abstract = "Training deep neural networks with the error backpropagation
              algorithm is considered implausible from a biological
              perspective. Numerous recent publications suggest elaborate
              models for biologically plausible variants of deep learning,
              typically defining success as reaching around 98\% test accuracy
              on the MNIST data set. Here, we investigate how far we can go on
              digit (MNIST) and object (CIFAR10) classification with
              biologically plausible, local learning rules in a network with
              one hidden layer and a single readout layer. The hidden layer
              weights are either fixed (random or random Gabor filters) or
              trained with unsupervised methods (PCA, ICA or Sparse Coding)
              that can be implemented by local learning rules. The readout
              layer is trained with a supervised, local learning rule. We first
              implement these models with rate neurons. This comparison
              reveals, first, that unsupervised learning does not lead to
              better performance than fixed random projections or Gabor filters
              for large hidden layers. Second, networks with localized
              receptive fields perform significantly better than networks with
              all-to-all connectivity and can reach backpropagation performance
              on MNIST. We then implement two of the networks - fixed,
              localized, random \& random Gabor filters in the hidden layer -
              with spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and spike timing
              dependent plasticity to train the readout layer. These spiking
              models achieve > 98.2\% test accuracy on MNIST, which is close to
              the performance of rate networks with one hidden layer trained
              with backpropagation. The performance of our shallow network
              models is comparable to most current biologically plausible
              models of deep learning. Furthermore, our results with a shallow
              spiking network provide an important reference and suggest the
              use of datasets other than MNIST for testing the performance of
              future models of biologically plausible deep learning.",

              learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions
              about unobserved data. In addition to using models for
              prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is
              receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this
              increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the
              notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the
              wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and
              what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to
              address these concerns by defining interpretability in the
              context of machine learning and introducing the predictive,
              descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing
              interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching
              desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive
              accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a
              human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of
              interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing
              techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with
              subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To
              demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to
              evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous
              real-world examples. These examples highlight the often
              underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of
              interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss
              limitations of existing methods and directions for future work.
              We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will
              make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss

              learning tool for achieving human-level performance on many
              learning tasks. Yet, due to its black-box nature, it is
              inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the input
              data drive the decisions of the network. There are various
              real-world scenarios in which humans need to make actionable
              decisions based on the output of a decision support system that
              makes use of DNNs. These decision support systems can be found in
              critical domains, such as legislation, law enforcement, and
              healthcare. It is important that the humans making high-level
              decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by
              combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context
              of the deployment of the decision support system and that the
              decisions made are legally or ethically defensible. Due to the
              incredible pace at which DNN technology is being developed and
              adopted, the development of new methods and studies on explaining
              the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active

              deep learning may be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal
              directions the field is taking. This complexity is further
              exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in defining what
              it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning
              system and to evaluate a system's ``ability to explain''. To
              alleviate this problem, this article offers a ``field guide'' to
              deep learning explainability for those uninitiated in the field.
              The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of a deep learning
              system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii)
              places explainability in the context of other related deep
              learning research areas, and iii) introduces three simple
              dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that
              contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is designed as

              models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task
              of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse

              information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages
              allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit

              between somatic ERCC2 mutations and the activity of a mutational
              signature characterized by a broad spectrum of base changes. In
              addition, we note an association between the activity of this
              signature and smoking that is independent of ERCC2 mutation
              status, providing genomic evidence of tobacco-related mutagenesis
              in urothelial cancer. Together, these analyses identify an

              cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to
              advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a
              powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity
              data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena
              presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine
              learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can
              result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions.
              Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate
              multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain
              the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone
              often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different
              sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate
              that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally
              complement each other to create robust predictive models that
              integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and
              explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature,
              highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions,
              and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four
              overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations,
              partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and
              theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage
              expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational
              biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics,
              experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective
              suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale
              modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help

              using multivariable Cox models. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We
              report the results of an international effort to reach a
              consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes. We identified a consensus
              set of six molecular classes: luminal papillary (24\%), luminal
              nonspecified (8\%), luminal unstable (15\%), stroma-rich (15\%),
              basal/squamous (35\%), and neuroendocrine-like (3\%). These
              consensus classes differ regarding underlying oncogenic
              mechanisms, infiltration by immune and stromal cells, and
              histological and clinical characteristics, including outcomes. We
              provide a single-sample classifier that assigns a consensus class
              label to a tumor sample's transcriptome. Limitations of the work
              are retrospective clinical data collection and a lack of complete
              information regarding patient treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This
              consensus system offers a robust framework that will enable
              testing and validation of predictive biomarkers in future
              prospective clinical trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: Bladder cancers are
              heterogeneous at the molecular level, and scientists have
              proposed several classifications into sets of molecular classes.
              While these classifications may be useful to stratify patients
              for prognosis or response to treatment, a consensus
              classification would facilitate the clinical use of molecular
              classes. Conducted by multidisciplinary expert teams in the
              field, this study proposes such a consensus and provides a tool
              for applying the consensus classification in the clinical
              setting.",

  abstract = "Motivation: Somatic mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor
              suppressor genes constitute a major category of causal genetic
              abnormalities in tumor cells. The mutation spectra of thousands
              of tumors have been generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
              and other whole genome (exome) sequencing projects. A promising
              approach to utilizing these resources for precision medicine is
              to identify genetic similarity-based sub-types within a cancer
              type and relate the pinpointed sub-types to the clinical outcomes
              and pathologic characteristics of patients. Results: We propose
              two novel methods, ccpwModel and xGeneModel, for mutation-based
              clustering of tumors. In the former, binary variables indicating
              the status of cancer driver genes in tumors and the genes'
              involvement in the core cancer pathways are treated as the
              features in the clustering process. In the latter, the functional
              similarities of putative cancer driver genes and their confidence
              scores as the 'true' driver genes are integrated with the
              mutation spectra to calculate the genetic distances between
              tumors. We apply both methods to the TCGA data of 16 cancer
              types. Promising results are obtained when these methods are
              compared to state-of-the-art approaches as to the associations
              between the determined tumor clusters and patient race (or
              survival time). We further extend the analysis to detect

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As DNA sequencing technologies are improving and
              getting cheaper, genomic data can be utilized for diagnosis of
              many diseases such as cancer. Human raw genome data is huge in
              size for computational systems. Therefore, there is a need for a
              compact and accurate representation of the valuable information
              in DNA. The occurrence of complex genetic disorders often results
              from multiple gene mutations. The effect of each mutation is not
              equal for the development of a disease. Inspired from the field
              of information retrieval, we propose using the term frequency
              (tf) and BM25 term weighting measures with the inverse document
              frequency (idf) and relevance frequency (rf) measures to weight
              genes based on their mutations. The underlying assumption is that
              the more mutations a gene has in patients with a certain disease
              and the less mutations it has in other patients, the more
              discriminative that gene is. RESULTS: We evaluated the proposed
              representations on the task of cancer type classification. We
              applied various machine learning techniques using the tf-idf and
              tf-rf schemes and their BM25 versions. Our results show that the
              BM25-tf-rf representation leads to improved classification
              accuracy and f-score values compared to the other
              representations. The highest accuracy (76.44\%) and f-score
              (76.95\%) are achieved with the BM25-tf-rf based data
              representation. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of our experiments, the
              BM25-tf-rf scheme and the proposed neural network model is shown
              to be the best performing classification system for our case
              study of cancer type classification. This system is further
              utilized for causal gene analysis. Examples from the most

  abstract = "Classification of high-throughput genomic data is a powerful
              method to assign samples to subgroups with specific molecular
              profiles. Consensus partitioning is the most widely applied
              approach to reveal subgroups by summarizing a consensus
              classification from a list of individual classifications
              generated by repeatedly executing clustering on random subsets of
              the data. It is able to evaluate the stability of the
              classification. We implemented a new R/Bioconductor package,
              cola, that provides a general framework for consensus
              partitioning. With cola, various parameters and methods can be
              user-defined and easily integrated into different steps of an
              analysis, e.g., feature selection, sample classification or
              defining signatures. cola provides a new method named ATC
              (ability to correlate to other rows) to extract features and
              recommends spherical k-means clustering (skmeans) for subgroup
              classification. We show that ATC and skmeans have better
              performance than other commonly used methods by a comprehensive
              benchmark on public datasets. We also benchmark key parameters in
              the consensus partitioning procedure, which helps users to select
              optimal parameter values. Moreover, cola provides rich
              functionalities to apply multiple partitioning methods in
              parallel and directly compare their results, as well as rich
              visualizations. cola can automate the complete analysis and

  abstract = "Disparity between genome-wide mutations in bladder and other
              cancers where smoking is a risk factor raises questions about
              carcinogenesis in different epithelia. To develop an experimental
              model of bladder carcinogenesis, we clonally expanded in vitro
              differentiated normal human urothelial (NHU) cells following
              exposure to an exemplar procarcinogen and used whole-genome DNA
              sequencing to derive mutational signatures. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)
              was activated by endogenous cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450
              family 1 subfamily A member 1 [CYP1A1]) to create genomically
              modified NHU cells. Comparison with the Catalogue of Somatic
              Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) showed that mutations induced by BaP
              in NHU cells were similar to smoking-associated signatures in
              bladder and other cancers, including single- and doublet-base
              substitution signatures characterised by C > A transversions
              (COSMIC\_SBS4 and COSMIC\_DBS2, respectively), and an
              insertion/deletion signature of C deletions in homopolymer
              regions (COSMIC ID3). Our study provides the first direct
              evidence that BaP is activated locally in the urothelium,
              initiating the well-described smoking-associated mutational
              signatures. An absence of other common bladder cancer
              (BLCA)-associated genomic signatures points strongly to other
              primary causes of BLCA, which the new experimental approach
              described here is well placed to investigate. Mutational
              signatures ignore whether genes are affected, but tissue-specific
              drivers (KMT2D, KMT2C, and CDKN1A) were significantly overmutated
              in this model, providing insight on the emergent selection
              pressures. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a carefully controlled laboratory
              setting, we exposed normal human urothelial tissues to a
              procarcinogen (benzo[a]pyrene) found in cigarette smoke. We show
              that the urothelial tissues activated the carcinogen and led to
              mutations forming across the genome in a characteristic pattern.
              This particular ``mutational signature'' is found in bladder
              tumours and other smoking-induced cancers (eg, lung); however,
              our study highlights that there are other unknown mutational
              processes in bladder cancer that is not the direct result of
              smoke carcinogens, and this will require further investigation.",

              temporal context vectors adapted from the temporal context model
              (TCM). These vectors are leaky integrators that could be
              constructed from a population of persistently firing cells. An
              array of temporal context vectors with different decay rates
              calculates the Laplace transform of real time events. Simple

                   that provides a synthetic perspective to explain why there

                   This framework characterizes how the sensorimotor control

              recall have revealed robust qualitative and quantitative
              characteristics, such as power laws governing recall capacity.
              Although abstract random matrix models could explain such laws,
              the possibility of their implementation in large networks of
              interacting neurons has so far remained unexplored. We study an
              attractor network model of long-term memory endowed with firing
              rate adaptation and global inhibition. Under appropriate
              conditions, the transitioning behaviour of the network from
              memory to memory is constrained by limit cycles that prevent the
              network from recalling all memories, with scaling similar to what
              has been found in experiments. When the model is supplemented
              with a heteroassociative learning rule, complementing the
              standard autoassociative learning rule, as well as short-term
              synaptic facilitation, our model reproduces other key findings in
              the free recall literature, namely serial position effects,
              contiguity and forward asymmetry effects, as well as the semantic
              effects found to guide memory recall. The model is consistent
              with a broad series of manipulations aimed at gaining a better
              understanding of the variables that affect recall, such as the
              role of rehearsal, presentation rates and

                 important role, only a few of these connections have been

              by -- and fitted to -- experimental data, but they rarely produce
              neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures
              suggest that current plasticity models are still
              under-constrained by existing data. Here, we present an
              alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover
              plausible synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental
              data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement
              and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we
              parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion
              and then use supervised learning methods (gradient descent or
              evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss
              function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity
              rule transforms an initially random network into one with the
              desired function. We first validate our approach by
              re-discovering previously described plasticity rules, starting at
              the single-neuron level and ``Oja's rule'', a simple Hebbian
              plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability
              of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We
              expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to
              find Oja's rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an
              initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover
              several principal components of the input space after learning.
              Next, we move to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with
              plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a
              target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. Our algorithm
              discovers a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can
              solve this task. Our work is a proof of principle of an automated
              and unbiased approach to unveil synaptic plasticity rules that
              obey biological constraints and can solve complex functions.

  abstract = "How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central
              question in neuroscience. Key to today's research into
              information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic
              plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's
              (1949) postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and
              persistently co-active cells should increase connective strength
              among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing
              a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not
              the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history.
              Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical
              frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were
              directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent
              years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where
              temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new
              learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity
              (STDP) - has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because
              of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological
              plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of
              today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of
              diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle,
              Locke, and Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticit{\`a} and
              Rosenblatt's perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of
              STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and
              experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred
              in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field,
              and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point
              out where the future directions may lie, which includes
              interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms
              and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to

              currently lack a detailed understanding of how these networks
              compute, recently developed optimization techniques allow us to
              instantiate increasingly complex functional spiking neural
              networks in-silico. These methods hold the promise to build more
              efficient non-von-Neumann computing hardware and will offer new

              accelerate the development of such methods, objective ways to
              compare their performance are indispensable. Presently, however,
              there are no widely accepted means for comparing the
              computational performance of spiking neural networks. To address
              this issue, we introduce two spike-based classification data
              sets, broadly applicable to benchmark both software and
              neuromorphic hardware implementations of spiking neural networks.
              To accomplish this, we developed a general audio-to-spiking
              conversion procedure inspired by neurophysiology. Furthermore, we
              applied this conversion to an existing and a novel speech data
              set. The latter is the free, high-fidelity, and word-level
              aligned Heidelberg digit data set that we created specifically

  abstract = "We discuss a recently proposed approach to solve the classic
              feature-binding problem in primate vision that uses neural
              dynamics known to be present within the visual cortex. Broadly,
              the feature-binding problem in the visual context concerns not
              only how a hierarchy of features such as edges and objects within
              a scene are represented, but also the hierarchical relationships
              between these features at every spatial scale across the visual
              field. This is necessary for the visual brain to be able to make
              sense of its visuospatial world. Solving this problem is an
              important step towards the development of artificial general
              intelligence. In neural network simulation studies, it has been
              found that neurons encoding the binding relations between visual
              features, known as binding neurons, emerge during visual training
              when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into
              the models. These biological network properties include (i)
              bottom-up, lateral and top-down synaptic connections, (ii)
              spiking neuronal dynamics, (iii) spike timing-dependent
              plasticity, and (iv) a random distribution of axonal transmission
              delays (of the order of several milliseconds) in the propagation
              of spikes between neurons. After training the network on a set of
              visual stimuli, modelling studies have reported observing the
              gradual emergence of polychronization through successive layers
              of the network, in which subpopulations of neurons have learned
              to emit their spikes in regularly repeating spatio-temporal
              patterns in response to specific visual stimuli. Such a
              subpopulation of neurons is known as a polychronous neuronal
              group (PNG). Some neurons embedded within these PNGs receive
              convergent inputs from neurons representing lower- and
              higher-level visual features, and thus appear to encode the
              hierarchical binding relationship between features. Neural
              activity with this kind of spatio-temporal structure robustly
              emerges in the higher network layers even when neurons in the
              input layer represent visual stimuli with spike timings that are
              randomized according to a Poisson distribution. The resulting
              hierarchical representation of visual scenes in such models,
              including the representation of hierarchical binding relations
              between lower- and higher-level visual features, is consistent
              with the hierarchical phenomenology or subjective experience of
              primate vision and is distinct from approaches interested in
              segmenting a visual scene into a finite set of objects.",

              explain how transform-invariant cells could develop in the visual
              system. However, a major limitation of computer modelling studies
              to date has been that the visual stimuli are typically presented
              one at a time to the network during training. In this paper, we
              investigate how vision models may self-organize when multiple
              stimuli are presented together within each visual image during
              training. We show that as the number of independent stimuli grows

              switch from learning representations of the multi-stimulus input
              patterns to representing the individual stimuli. Furthermore, the

              computational models of object recognition. Typically, many
              objects make up a complex natural scene and are never presented

              invariant object selective responses. In this paper, we present a
              model of the ventral visual stream, VisNet, which can solve the
              problem of learning object selective representations even when
              multiple objects are always present during training. Past

              when training comprises many different object pairs. Numerous
              pairings are required for statistical decoupling between objects.

              presented successively with discrete volleys of input spikes STDP

              Learning was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with

              fundamental challenge for neuroscience. In particular,

              motivation, and creativity? This paper argues that these features
              can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring
              any higher-level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic
              plasticity (DEP) as a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems

              case. Without specifying any purpose or goal, seemingly
              purposeful and adaptive rhythmic behavior is developed,

              surprising results require no system-specific modifications of

              reinforcement learning (RL), coadaptation, and shaping. RL allows
              the BMI control algorithm to learn to complete tasks from
              interactions with the environment, rather than an explicit
              training signal. Coadaption enables continuous, synergistic
              adaptation between the BMI control algorithm and BMI user working
              in changing environments. Shaping is designed to reduce the
              learning curve for BMI users attempting to control a prosthetic.
              Here, we present the theory and in vivo experimental paradigm to
              illustrate how this BMI learns to complete a reaching task using
              a prosthetic arm in a 3-D workspace based on the user's neuronal
              activity. This semisupervised learning framework does not require
              user movements. We quantify BMI performance in closed-loop brain
              control over six to ten days for three rats as a function of
              increasing task difficulty. All three subjects coadapted with
              their BMI control algorithms to control the prosthetic
              significantly above chance at each level of difficulty.",

              weights underlie learning. It is unclear, however, how the brain
              is able to determine which synapses should change, and by how
              much. This uncertainty stands in sharp contrast to deep learning,
              where changes in weights are explicitly engineered to optimize
              performance. However, the main tool for doing that,
              backpropagation, is not biologically plausible, and networks
              trained with this rule tend to forget old tasks when learning new
              ones. Here we introduce the Dendritic Gated Network (DGN), a
              variant of the Gated Linear Network [[1][1], [2][2]], which
              offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.
              DGNs combine dendritic ``gating'' (whereby interneurons target
              dendrites to shape neuronal response) with local learning rules
              to yield provably efficient performance. They are significantly
              more data efficient than conventional artificial networks and are
              highly resistant to forgetting, and we show that they perform
              well on a variety of tasks, in some cases better than
              backpropagation. The DGN bears similarities to the cerebellum,
              where there is evidence for shaping of Purkinje cell responses by
              interneurons. It also makes several experimental predictions, one

               and unpredictable world, an intelligent agent should hold its
               own meta-goal of self-preservation, like living organisms whose
               survival relies on homeostasis: the regulation of body states
               aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. In
               organisms capable of mental states, feelings are a mental
               expression of the state of life in the body and play a critical
               role in regulating behaviour. Our goal here is to inquire about
               conditions that would potentially allow machines to care about
               what they do or think. Under certain conditions, machines
               capable of implementing a process resembling homeostasis might
               also acquire a source of motivation and a new means to evaluate
               behaviour, akin to that of feelings in living organisms. Drawing
               on recent developments in soft robotics and multisensory

              sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the
              structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however,
              protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally.
              Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging
              genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid
              residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous
              sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3.
              Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate
              predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which
              convey more information about the structure than contact
              predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of
              mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein.
              We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple
              gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex
              sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold,
              achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous
              sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure
              Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment of the state of the
              field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template
              modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free
              modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used
              sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only
              14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance
              in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased
              accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of
              proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for

              globally, and ∼20\% of patients with Parkinson's disease have not
              been diagnosed as such. The clinical diagnosis is costly: there
              are no specific tests or biomarkers and it can take days to
              diagnose as it relies on a holistic evaluation of the
              individual's symptoms. Existing research either predicts a
              Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale rating, uses other key
              Parkinsonian features such as tapping, gait, and tremor to
              diagnose an individual, or focuses on different audio features.
              Methods: In this article, we present a classification approach
              implemented as an iOS App to detect whether an individual has
              Parkinson's using 10-s audio clips of the individual saying

  abstract = "This paper attempts to answer a central question in unsupervised
              learning: what does it mean to ``make sense'' of a sensory
              sequence? In our formalization, making sense involves
              constructing a symbolic causal theory that both explains the
              sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions.
              The unity conditions insist that the constituents of the causal
              theory -- objects, properties, and laws -- must be integrated
              into a coherent whole. On our account, making sense of sensory
              input is a type of program synthesis, but it is unsupervised
              program synthesis. Our second contribution is a computer
              implementation, the Apperception Engine, that was designed to
              satisfy the above requirements. Our system is able to produce
              interpretable human-readable causal theories from very small
              amounts of data, because of the strong inductive bias provided by
              the unity conditions. A causal theory produced by our system is
              able to predict future sensor readings, as well as retrodict
              earlier readings, and impute (fill in the blanks of) missing
              sensory readings, in any combination. In fact, it is able to do
              all three tasks simultaneously. We tested the engine in a diverse
              variety of domains, including cellular automata, rhythms and
              simple nursery tunes, multi-modal binding problems, occlusion
              tasks, and sequence induction intelligence tests. In each domain,
              we test our engine's ability to predict future sensor values,
              retrodict earlier sensor values, and impute missing sensory data.
              The Apperception Engine performs well in all these domains,
              significantly out-performing neural net baselines. We note in
              particular that in the sequence induction intelligence tests, our
              system achieved human-level performance. This is notable because
              our system is not a bespoke system designed specifically to solve
              intelligence tests, but a general-purpose system that was
              designed to make sense of any sensory sequence.",

                   (RL) aims at empowering one's capabilities in behavioural
                   decision making by using interaction experience with the
                   world and an evaluative feedback. Unlike traditional
                   supervised learning methods that usually rely on one-shot,
                   exhaustive and supervised reward signals, RL tackles with
                   sequential decision making problems with sampled, evaluative

  author   = "Masoudi-Sobhanzadeh, Yosef and Motieghader, Habib and
              Masoudi-Nejad, Ali",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Feature selection, as a preprocessing stage, is a
              challenging problem in various sciences such as biology,
              engineering, computer science, and other fields. For this
              purpose, some studies have introduced tools and softwares such as
              WEKA. Meanwhile, these tools or softwares are based on filter
              methods which have lower performance relative to wrapper methods.
              In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce a
              software application called FeatureSelect. In addition to filter
              methods, FeatureSelect consists of optimisation algorithms and
              three types of learners. It provides a user-friendly and
              straightforward method of feature selection for use in any kind
              of research, and can easily be applied to any type of balanced
              and unbalanced data based on several score functions like
              accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. RESULTS: In addition to
              our previously introduced optimisation algorithm (WCC), a total
              of 10 efficient, well-known and recently developed algorithms
              have been implemented in FeatureSelect. We applied our software
              to a range of different datasets and evaluated the performance of
              its algorithms. Acquired results show that the performances of
              algorithms are varying on different datasets, but WCC, LCA, FOA,
              and LA are suitable than others in the overall state. The results
              also show that wrapper methods are better than filter methods.
              CONCLUSIONS: FeatureSelect is a feature or gene selection
              software application which is based on wrapper methods.
              Furthermore, it includes some popular filter methods and
              generates various comparison diagrams and statistical
              measurements. It is available from GitHub (
              https://github.com/LBBSoft/FeatureSelect ) and is free open

                   50 years ago. Like other artificial intelligence techniques,
                   evolutionary algorithms will likely see increased use and
                   development due to the increased availability of
                   computation, more robust and available open source software
                   libraries, and the increasing demand for artificial
                   intelligence techniques. As these techniques become more
                   adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a
                   perspective of their ability to integrate into society and
                   the human processes they intend to augment. In this review,
                   we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms and
                   resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the
                   ability to manage the control of the environment with
                   limiters, the ability to explain and repeat the search
                   process, the ability to understand input and output
                   causality within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm
                   bias due to data or user design, and lastly, the ability to
                   add corrective measures. These areas are motivated by
                   today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies
                   concerns and new government regulatory rules. As many

               alternative approach to optimization, in recent years
               backpropagation through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has
               come to dominate the fields of neural network optimization and
               deep learning. One hypothesis for the absence of EAs in deep
               learning is that modern neural networks have become so high
               dimensional that evolution with its inexact gradient cannot
               match the exact gradient calculations of backpropagation.
               Furthermore, the evaluation of a single individual in evolution
               on the big data sets now prevalent in deep learning would
               present a prohibitive obstacle towards efficient optimization.
               This paper challenges these views, suggesting that EAs can be
               made to run significantly faster than previously thought by
               evaluating individuals only on a small number of training
               examples per generation. Surprisingly, using this approach with
               only a simple EA (called the limited evaluation EA or LEEA) is
               competitive with the performance of the state-of-the-art SGD
               variant RMSProp on several benchmarks with neural networks with
               over 1,000 weights. More investigation is warranted, but these
               initial results suggest the possibility that EAs could be the
               first viable training alternative for deep learning outside of
               SGD, thereby opening up deep learning to all the tools of

                   overcoming this crucial weakness sometimes at the cost of
                   scarifying accuracy for interpretability. The applications

                   recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the
                   natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel
                   scientific insights and discoveries from observational or
                   simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific
                   outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain
                   explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency.
                   In this article we review explainable machine learning in
                   view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss
                   three core elements which we identified as relevant in this
                   context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability.
                   With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of
                   recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning
                   and the way that explainable machine learning is used in
                   combination with domain knowledge from the application
                   areas.",

              interpretability, technical challenges, and possible

  abstract      = "Methods for understanding the decisions of and mechanisms
                   underlying deep neural networks (DNNs) typically rely on
                   building intuition by emphasizing sensory or semantic
                   features of individual examples. For instance, methods aim
                   to visualize the components of an input which are
                   ``important'' to a network's decision, or to measure the
                   semantic properties of single neurons. Here, we argue that
                   interpretability research suffers from an over-reliance on
                   intuition-based approaches that risk-and in some cases have
                   caused-illusory progress and misleading conclusions. We
                   identify a set of limitations that we argue impede
                   meaningful progress in interpretability research, and
                   examine two popular classes of interpretability
                   methods-saliency and single-neuron-based approaches-that
                   serve as case studies for how overreliance on intuition and
                   lack of falsifiability can undermine interpretability
                   research. To address these concerns, we propose a strategy
                   to address these impediments in the form of a framework for
                   strongly falsifiable interpretability research. We encourage
                   researchers to use their intuitions as a starting point to
                   develop and test clear, falsifiable hypotheses, and hope
                   that our framework yields robust, evidence-based
                   interpretability methods that generate meaningful advances
                   in our understanding of DNNs.",
